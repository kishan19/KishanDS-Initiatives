England 2nd innings,52.3,"Pat Cummins to Woakes, out Caught by Smith!! There goes England's fortress -- in Paine's words, the sixteenth most intimidating ground in the world, and in poetic justice, it is Steven Smith who grabs the last word. Cummins has his fourth, banging it in short. And Woakes has clearly unearthed a big visible chink in his batting armoury, messing up yet another short delivery. It stuck in the pitch, spat in awkwardly and then fended up off the fending gloves to second slip. Yes, HE's waiting there .. Woakes c Smith b Pat Cummins 37(54) [4s-7]",10,,,,,,,,"ENG vs AUS, 1st Test, The Ashes 2019"
England 2nd innings,52.2,"Pat Cummins to Woakes, no run, quite an ugly pull, reminiscent of what he did to a short one in the first innings, pulling from in front of his face with his eyes closed",10,,,,,,,,"ENG vs AUS, 1st Test, The Ashes 2019"

England 2nd innings,51.6,"Lyon to Anderson, FOUR, talk about this safe edging technique. Anderson defends, the spin gets big, takes the outside edge, and ensures it flies just wide of second slip - Smith, again ..",10,,,,,,,,"ENG vs AUS, 1st Test, The Ashes 2019"
England 2nd innings,51.5,"Lyon to Woakes, 1 run, another dance down, this time managing to whip it safely into mid-wicket. Okay Jimmy, one ball ..",10,,,,,,,,"ENG vs AUS, 1st Test, The Ashes 2019"

England 2nd innings,50.5,"Siddle to Woakes, FOUR, dropped. It was a wild slash, it was a thick edge flying quickly to second slip's left, but no, Steven Smith isn't all that good.

England 2nd innings,48.6,"Siddle to Woakes, no run, 86.1mph, and he quickly realizes the uselessness of wanting quick singles with Anderson and his dodgy calf - dabbing it away to gully, and letting him deal with Lyon",10,,,,,,,,"ENG vs AUS, 1st Test, The Ashes 2019"
England 2nd innings,48.5,"Siddle to Woakes, no run, 85.5mph, really full. Woakes isn't looking for quick singles here one bit .. happily blocking it out",10,,,,,,,,"ENG vs AUS, 1st Test, The Ashes 2019"

England 2nd innings,47.4,"Lyon to Broad, out Caught by Smith!! Five. Six. Consecutive numbers, consecutive balls. Poor Broad, he's had to make himself a statistic in these times when all his more-qualified batsmen have deserted him.

England 2nd innings,47.3,"Lyon to Moeen Ali, out Caught by Warner!! The trap's right there for the world to see. Surely Moeen's seen it. And he'll still be forced to walk blindly into it. Such has been Lyon's mastery here -- the Goat turns Spiderman with this bloody good web of spin. He has his fifth victim, the first time he's getting five in England, and he gets it with a snorter. It's drifting into middle, forcing Ali to defend, which he does with hard hands, getting squared up big time as the outside edge goes to short gully at the perfect height.

Such a lovely knock this has been by the left-hander, replicating what Smith did for Australia. Played out the new ball initially and has kept getting those boundaries at regular intervals - against the spinner as well as the pacers. His team mates in the dressing room are proud of his effort as they give him a standing ovation. Needs to convert this one into a big one though, his job isn't done yet. Getting back to the ball - he had clipped it towards mid-wicket and called for a quick single to bring up the magical three-digit mark. There was a direct-hit at the bowler's end, but the batsman is well in. Magical moment, indeed...",5,,,,,,,,"ENG vs AUS, 1st Test, The Ashes 2019"
