After all those outswingers, Marsh gets one to curl into the right-hander and Bairstow had no clue against it.

No conclusive evidence, but also, to the naked eye, no visible daylight between bat and ball and nothing else that could have produced the noise.

Another short delivery that refuses to bounce, Bairstow bends and arches back, but the low bounce does him in, the ball hits the sweatband on the glove before lobbing to third slip.

But Head - after a long plea - has a damn reluctant Smith's blessings to take it upstairs -- only to see three reds on the big screen. It pitches on middle, nips in and is struck on the knee roll. Head's already quite short, plus he's deep in the crease as well. Yea, the perfect recipe for disaster.
