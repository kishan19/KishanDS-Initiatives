India 1st innings,15.3,"Anrich Nortje to Kohli, out Lbw!! Nortje's maiden Test scalp is Virat Kohli. Time to update your CV, mate. Couldn't have asked for any better. Perfect nip-backer from the pacer. Like Rabada setting up Pujara, Nortje too followed the same ploy to nip out the Indian captain. Shaped in sharply off the deck, Kohli plays all around it with feet chained to the crease. It eludes the inside edge and thuds him on the pad around the knee roll. The moment it struck him, Kohli knew that he was in trouble.

This time umpire Chris Gaffaney had no second thoughts in giving it out and it proved to be a fair call in the end.
