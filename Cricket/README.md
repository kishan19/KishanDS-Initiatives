- Who has spent the most time at the top of the international cricket rankings

This is possible thanks to datewise rankings released by the ICC http://www.relianceiccrankings.com/datespecific/test/?stattype=batting&day=18&month=02&year=2019 on their datespecific website. 

The first step is to compile all the URLs for the particular year. Then, process the URLs one by one, to find out which player has spent the most number of days in the time between the two spots.

Then a function is used to preprocess a few data inside pandas. This is processed as a dataframe which can be used for query purposes or integrated as part of a chatbot.
