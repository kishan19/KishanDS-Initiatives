CONFIDENTIAL iv IPA EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report evaluates the performance of the Angsi-D Development Project, which was  executed in Malaysia. Petronas Carigali Sdn. Bhd. (PCSB) and Exxon-Mobil Exploration & Production Malaysia Inc. (EMEPMI) are the joint venture (JV) partners with equal shares in the Angsi field. The Angsi field is being operated by PCSB under the main terms and conditions of  the gas production sharing contract (GPSC) signed in November 1998. The completed project  facilities will be operated by PCSB, except for the host tie-ins at Guntong-D (GuD), Irong Barat- A (IBA), Seligi-A (SeA), and the Onshore Slugcatcher (OSC), which will be operated by EMEPMI. The Angsi field is located approximately 165 km off the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia in a water depth of 69 m. The Angsi Development has completed three phases (Phase I, II, and III) since the 1990s. Phase IV is the current phased development for the Angsi field and  it includes the Angsi-D Satellite drilling platform (AnDP-D), the associated pipelines, and the  host tie-in to the Angsi-A complex."
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The Angsi-D Project’s objective was to develop oil and gas reserves in the southwest area of the field with monetization of 64 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). The development will provide incremental oil of 15 to 20 thousand stock tank barrels per day (kstbd) to existing production. The amount of recoverable gas is 128.6 Bcf, which is included in the reserves. The above recoverable volume will be depleted with 11 development wells and with 5 optional wells. The plan was to drill 10 oil producer wells, 3 gas injector wells, and 3 water injector wells.  "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Angsi-D was developed as a satellite unmanned platform, and it was connected with three intrafield pipelines and controlled remotely from the AnPG-A platform. The first oil date was initially targeted for December 2008; however, this was not achieved until May 2009 because of the delay in awarding the platform contract and rig availability. The total estimated capital cost of the Angsi-D Development Project at sanction (23 November 2007) was RM1,267 million, including RM470 million for the AnDP-D drilling platform, RM334 million for three intrafield pipelines, and RM464 million for the drilling program. At project completion, the facilities (platform and intrafield pipelines) cost had decreased by 16 percent from the sanctioned cost estimate. The substantial decrease in cost was mainly due to the negotiated contract price of the Procure, Construct, and Commission (PCC) contract for the facilities scope after sanction. The drilling campaign has not yet been completed; however, the project team has forecasted that the drilling cost will not significantly deviate from the sanction estimate even after changes are made to the wells design.

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"At the component level, the capital cost for the project’s intrafield pipelines was substantially higher than Industry. The result was driven by high installation and transportation costs. The project team’s base plan was to complete the installation of the intrafield pipelines in one campaign; however, the installation vessel promised to the Angsi-D Development Project team was given to other higher-priority projects within the PCSB portfolio. The installation campaign was completed over two sessions. The installation vessels and contracts were managed (which includes scheduling of all installation vessels) by the Department of Installation (DFIN12) within PCSB, and the project team had little control over the type of vessels and contract rates.

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Committee (UCEC13) metrics because the AnDP-D platform can support a tender assisted drilling (TAD) rig, which is not part of the wellhead platform (WHP) cost model. As a result, the platform cost index should be interpreted with caution, because it does not take into account variables such as water depth, maximum wave height, hydrocarbon throughput, and number of slots. The analysis shows that the AnDP-D platform cost is more expensive than other projects in Asia (and global projects) of similar jacket and topside weight. If the topside dry weight and water depth are considered, the jacket weight is more than 27 percent heavier than a typical similar project executed in Asia and more than 16 percent heavier than projects executed globally. These results support IPA’s conclusion that the Angsi-D platform was installed at a premium compared with Petronas’ competitors in the upstream industry. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Conversely, compared to similar projects, the Angsi-D Development Project’s wells estimated cost of RM464 million was competitive. The concept for this field and reservoir complexity is industry average as indicated by the cost index of 1.03. If the team’s prediction that drilling costs will not deviate from the estimate holds true, the drilling team will maintain its drilling competitiveness (Wells Component Cost Index of 0.62).  "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Finally, the Angsi-D Development Project experienced a cost decrease of 16 percent for  the facilities scope. The cost deviation was predominantly driven by the team’s ability to  negotiate a lower contract price post project sanction."

It is DFIN’s responsibility to schedule installation vessels for the project team once the project team has indicated the installation specifications and installation dates.

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The actual execution schedule duration, start of detailed engineering to first oil, was 32 months. Approximately 8 months was removed or normalised from the actual execution duration because the project was put on hold until legal issues with the fabrication contractor were resolved. Therefore, the adjusted actual execution duration, as shown in Table 2, is 24 months. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The Angsi-D Development Project team was asked to fast track the project schedule to meet management’s first oil request. The project team reduced the definition and engineering phases to 3 months each by using the same WHP design as that of the Angsi-B platform. Moreover, the project team engaged detailed design before project sanction to allow adequate time for procurement and fabrication. Pre-sanction detailed design deviated from the PCSB project delivery process but was approved by management. To meet the first oil date the project team awarded the pipeline fabrication and long-lead equipment contracts prior to project sanction (which also deviated from the PCSB project delivery process). However, because the rig could not be secured as planned, the fast tracking was eroded yielding an industry average schedule result.  "

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The appraisal philosophy for Angsi-D was Aggressive. The Angsi-D field was appraised with one well, and the remaining data were provided from previous drilling campaigns (data from over 100 wells) close to the Angsi-D field. However, the highly stacked and compartmentalized reservoir features in the Angsi-D field prohibited an accurate correlation with the nearby wells data. Based on the available subsurface data, the subsurface team achieved an industry average Reservoir Front-End Loading (FEL) Index. The Facilities FEL also matched Industry average, and the weakest area in definition was project execution planning (PEP). Pipeline FEL was also Fair, similar to the industry average but less defined than Best Practical at sanction. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Wells FEL was better than industry average at sanction, driven by the routine well designs. CONFIDENTIAL x IPA The Angsi-D Development Project scope was relatively conventional. PCSB has ample  experience in the region installing WHPs and pipelines. The platform design was based on the Angsi-B platform, which enabled the Angsi-D Development Project team to work around the lack  of experienced staff and perceived schedule pressures. The wells design was also relatively routine within PCSB. The technology employed is  industry-proven, but was new and potentially challenging to the team members. The subsurface  and drilling team conducted various technical peer reviews during the life of the project. The facilities team used 11 percent of the Asset and Facilities VIPs applicable to the Angsi-D Development Project, which is below the industry average of 27 percent of VIPs use. Nine VIPs were applicable to the Angsi-D Development Project, and the team used only 3D CAD during FEED and detailed engineering. The subsurface team applied one out of six  relevant Subsurface VIPs (SSVIPs), or 17 percent. The team used 3D visualization to analyse  the reservoir. Project Execution Discipline IPA evaluates Execution Discipline, which comprises several key factors that play a role  in the successful execution of E&P projects. IPA evaluates project control as measured by the Project Control Index (PCI); the incidence of key team member turnover; and the frequency and  impact of major late changes. Table 5 summarises the project execution discipline for the Angsi- D Development Project.

The Angsi-D Development Project’s PCI rating was Deficient, which is lower than the Industry and PCSB averages of Poor. The lack of a project controls specialist and estimate  validation process contributed to the poor rating. The project experienced major late changes. Ongoing optimisation studies after sanction caused scope and design changes to the wells  campaign, which affected the drilling campaign’s cost and schedule. Integral to the project was  the experience and continuity of the project manager through project definition and execution. Unlike most PCSB projects, project manager turnover was not an issue for the Angsi-D Development Project. However, the project faced numerous turnovers in key staff positions  throughout execution.

Despite the routine facilities technology, adopting a similar platform design from previous phases, and performing detailed engineering prior to project sanction, the project team’s cost and schedule estimate was too conservative resulting in an expensive facility. The poor facilities outcomes are also attributed to the lack of control over the installation vessels and rig.  "

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"1. Using previous Angsi design helped schedule performance. The AnDP-D platform was based on the Angsi-B WHP design. The team modified the existing design to suit the seabed strength and drilling rig requirements. This approach was much faster than starting the AnDP-D design from scratch, and was especially helpful given the project’s time constraints. "

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The Angsi-D Development Project began engineering before key subsurface study results were available to support and finalise the well construction scope. The project team suffered from several well design changes as a result. Historically, projects that obtained all basic data before entering the Define phase achieved their business objectives more often than did projects that lacked timely basic data. Providing basic subsurface data early improves operability and production attainment.  "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,3. Continuity in key discipline positions helps achieve predictable project outcomes.
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The Angsi-D Development Project suffered a high number of key team member turnovers. Project team turnovers are detrimental to the execution schedule and erode predictability of project outcomes. Turnover of key team members should be avoided. If turnover is unavoidable, Petronas should give proper attention to retention, succession, and transition plans to ensure an adequate and timely handover of project activities and responsibilities, including the communication of issues that have already been resolved.

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"4. Good project execution planning is key to project success. The project execution  plan (PEP) is a key document in any project and serves as the basis for the project  team to effectively progress into each phase. Although the Angsi-D Development Project was not complicated in terms of technology, it was schedule and resource  constrained. The weak PEP, led by a weak schedule, hindered the project team’s  efforts to respond to the constraints. 5. Estimate validation helps to achieve cost competitiveness. The project controls for  the Angsi-D Development Project were Deficient. The lack of estimate validation  contributed to the high costs compared with Industry for similar WHP and pipelines."

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The business objective for the Angsi-D Development Project was to develop oil and gas reserves in the southwest area of the field with monetization of 35 million stock tank barrels (MMstb) of oil, 4.4 MMstb of condensate (or 39 MMstb total liquids), 82 billion standard cubic feet (Bscf) of non-associated gas, and 62 Bscf of associated gas (or 144 Bscf total gases). "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd’s (PCSB) business driver was to achieve first oil production in the  fourth quarter of 2007. This first-oil target was then changed and confirmed for 11 December 2008 at project sanction. The development seeks to provide incremental 15 to 20 kstb oil to  existing production. The Angsi-D Development Project’s objective was to develop the Angsi-D field with a  four-legged drilling platform (AnDP-D) and drill 11 development wells to recover oil and gas from  the Angsi-D field. The plan was to send the full well stream (FWS) to the AnDR-A platform,  about 11 km away. First oil was reached on 31 May 2009 with an approximate 16 percent cost underrun. The cost estimate at sanction was RM1,267 million. The wells program is ongoing, has slipped  from the planned schedule, and the last well is expected to be complete by 9 April 2010. FIELD DESCRIPTION"
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The Angsi field has five areas: Main, West, North, South, and Southwest. The areal distribution of the hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs is the basis for these areas. The Angsi-D field is located in the Southwest area, and its reserves are from the Group I sands. The major oil contributors are I-27 and I-35U with additional production from I-15L, I-100, and I-72. The hydrocarbon accumulation is composed of fluvial clastics of the Miocene. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"I-27/35U contains 64 percent of the reserves-in-place and I-15 covers 23 percent. The I- 27/35U sands are in communication forming a single reservoir that shares the same fluid  contacts and fluid gradient. The porosity is 15 to 30 percent pore volume, and the gas-oil contact  ranges between 1,640 to 1,646 m true vertical depth subsea (tvdss) with a gas cap and oil leg."
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The pressure in the reservoir is lower than the bubble point, which dictated the need for gas and water injection. The reservoir has minimal faulting. I-15 has the largest accumulation with a gas cap and oil leg present. The reservoir is approximately 1 m to 4 m thick with excellent permeability. "

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The Angsi-D Development Project scope includes the following: • A four-legged unmanned satellite drilling platform (AnDP-D) with 16 conductors. The platform has a power generation system with a micro turbine generator to supply all the electrical power on the platform. The AnDP-D is designed to support a tender assisted drilling (TAD) rig. • Three new intrafield pipelines to connect the AnDP-D to the Angsi-A complex.  – 12 inch x 11 km carbon steel pipeline multiphase electric resistant welding to transport the hydrocarbon from AnDP-D to AnDR-A  – 6 inch x 9.8 km CS pipeline to transport gas lift from AnDR-A to AnDP-D  – 10 inch x 11 km CS pipeline to transport water injection from AnDR-A to AnDP-D • The drilling program at sanction was to drill 11 (8 producer and 3 injectors) development wells plus 5 optional wells if additional recoverable volumes were found. Fourteen wells will be drilled with a trajectory of “build and hold,” and the remaining two wells will have a horizontal profile. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"PROJECT HISTORY Angsi-D is the fourth phase of an overall Angsi Field development. The Angsi-D Development Project was included in the latest revision (Rev 3, submitted in 2005) of the FDP,  which was used to develop Phase 1, 2, and 3. Field Discovery and Appraisal"
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Between 1999 to March 2004, the Angsi FDP was revised to accommodate the development of Phase 1, 2, and 3. These phases developed the majority of the Angsi field recovering more than 350 MMBOE. To date, the Angsi field has installed four platforms and associated pipelines. The Angsi-A complex (developed during FDP Rev1) is the gas hub to secure supply to Peninsular Malaysia.   "

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"July 2005 and approved in March 2006. Revision 3 included additional information provided from the first appraisal well, Angsi-8, drilled in August 2004 in the Southwest area of the Angsi field. Angsi-8’s main objectives were to appraise the fluid content, structure, stratigraphy, and core, and to obtain MDT data from the I-27/35U sands. During this appraisal study, the Angsi-8 well discovered the I-72 oil reservoir and updated the I-35 Extension Development and I-25 "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Channel. The FDP Revision 3 developed hydrocarbon reserves in the Southwest area of the  field. The FDP Revision 3 set the basis for conceptual engineering, the design basis  memorandum, and the detailed design elements for the satellite platform AnDP-D and AnPG-A Complex Facility Upgrade. Select and Define Phase"
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"After the FDP Revision 3 was approved by PMU, the project team, driven by the first-oil target, obtained approval from CMC for initial funding to cover project management, pre-engineering, and detailed design costs. The funds were endorsed in November 2005. PCSB approved the overall contracting strategy in June 2006. MMC was awarded conceptual and detailed design. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"In September 2006, detailed engineering started, and the Project Integrated Review #2  was done for the conceptual and detailed design in December 2006. MMC approved the P&IDs  for construction in December 2006. At that time, the project team forecasted first oil in the fourth  quarter of 2007. In September 2006, Petronas approved the tender plan for the jacket and topside. The  project team began the contracting process and submitted the recommendation to Petronas Carigali Sdn. Bhd. (PCSB) in December 2006. Ramunia Fabricator Sdn. Bhd. (RFSB) was the  recommended contractor for fabrication. CMC approved the recommendation in February 2007."
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"From March to November 2007, the contract award was put on hold by CMC because of legal issues between RFSB and Carigali-PTTEP17 Operating Company (CPOC). Project sanction was therefore delayed, and awarding of the contracts had to wait until 8 months later when the legal issues between the contractors and suppliers were resolved. The majority of the project team worked on the Sotong Project in the interim. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"During the legal negotiations, JP Kenny worked on the pipeline designs and Mitco Japan  procured the pipeline material. Execution Activities Pre-Sanction During September 2007, the team pre-laid the 6-inch and 12-inch pipelines. The plan   was to install all three pipelines in one campaign before the monsoon season began in November 2007; however, the installation vessel was mobilised to another project. The 10-inch  pipeline was preserved for 1 year before it could be installed. In October 2007, the project team reviewed the project schedule, and as a consequence  of the legal delay the first oil target was reset to December 2008. Project Sanction 17 PTTEP is a national petroleum exploration and production company in Thailand. CONFIDENTIAL 4 IPA The legal issues pertaining to RFSB were resolved due to Petronas’ intervention, and PCSB approved the project in November 2007. The team awarded the platform (jacket and  topside) fabrication soon afterwards. The new first hydrocarbon date was confirmed for 11 December 2008, and the  recoverable resource was 38.9 MMstb of oil and 143.8 Bcf of gas or a total of 63.7 MMBOE. Within this period, the drilling lead, facilities lead, and project controller moved to another  project because of professional development. Project Execution Jacket and topside fabrication was loaded out and piles/conductors were completed in October 2008, and were installed by November 2008 with minimal issues. Hook-up and commissioning (HUC) commenced in November 2008 and was completed  in May 2009. Offshore installation and hook-up occurred during the monsoon period from November 2008 to February 2009. During the HUC phase, the project faced resource issues, as RFSB had laid people off because of cash-flow problems. The first hydrocarbon date was moved to May 2009 because the project team could not  secure a rig to commence the drilling campaign. In December 2008, the subsurface team revised the recoverable volume to 41.8"

Also, the designs of the wells had multiple changes during this time, which included modifying three wells to extended reach drilling profiles, changes to target depths, and completion arrangements (single to dual completions).  "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"In January 2009, the TAD rig contract was signed with Tioman T10, which would commence drilling the first Angsi-D well in April 2009. The T10 rig completed its drilling campaign early for the previous project. The Angsi-D Development Project team secured the remaining drilling slot in September 2009 before the rig had to be mobilised for another drilling campaign. The negotiated rig rate was US$90,000 per day. The cost estimate at sanction assumed a day rate based on SeaRex-9 TAD of US$130,000 per day.  "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The project team is also considering a new TAD rig from Kecana. Fabrication of the new TAD rig is expected to be completed by November 2009. On 15 May 2009, the first producer well was drilled. However, first oil could not flow  because a blowout preventer valve was installed incorrectly on the WHP. On 31 May 2009, the  team achieved first oil. The drilling campaign will continue until April 2010. PROJECT MANAGEMENT ISSUES Team Integration IPA defines an integrated team as a team of full- or part-time representatives covering all  key disciplines, identified prior to project sanction, and having specific responsibilities that are  defined and understood by all team members with authority to make decisions. Research shows CONFIDENTIAL 5 IPA   that having an integrated team results in better overall project performance. For example,  projects with integrated teams require less contingency than projects without integrated teams. The Angsi-D Development Project team was Integrated. The project had dedicated  functional groups for the Angsi field development which resulted in faster flow of key data  amongst the groups. The Operations group was involved from the beginning of the project. Roles and responsibilities were defined and understood by the Angsi team members. Contracting Strategy The Angsi-D Development Project’s overall contracting strategy was approved in June"
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"2006. To accomplish the business objectives and project objectives, the team did the soil boring, site, and route surveys using PCSB’s existing umbrella contractors. MMC did the conceptual design, FEED, and detailed engineering for the WHP. MMC had a lump-sum contract with a unit rate for any change. JP Kenny was awarded the pipeline design under a lump-sum contract.  "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The Angsi-D Development Project adopted a Procure, Construct and Commission (PCC) lump-sum contracting strategy for the WHP scope, awarded to RFSB. Major items were procured through the Supply Chain Management department within PCSB. The long-lead equipment contract was awarded by competitive bidding to local suppliers licensed by Petronas.  "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"A Vendor Development Program was initiated to improve the manufacturing capabilities in Malaysia and the project was required to use approved vendors in this program. The vendors were chosen based on an open bid tendering process, which screened first for technical capabilities and second for the lowest bid. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,The team used an existing contract with Mitco Japan Sdn. Bhd. for structural steel and  pipeline procurement. Pipeline coating was awarded to Bredero Shaw. The Transportation and Installation contract was established under an existing umbrella  arrangement with TL Offshore Sdn Bhd (TLO). The umbrella contract was managed under the

All projects that require a workboat, barge, or any floating vessels need to submit a request to the construction department to engage TLO. TLO was responsible for sourcing the vessels for the requested work schedule as agreed on during planning each year. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The installation vessels for the WHP and pipelines for the Angsi-D Development Project were  therefore contracted to TLO. The Sea Horizon and Enterprise 3 installation vessels were  contracted to install the Angsi-D pipelines at a rate of RM163,248 per day in 2008. In 2009, the Enterprise 3 rate increased to RM185,736 per day. CONFIDENTIAL 6 IPA BASIS OF COMPARISON"

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,APPRAISAL PHILOSOPHY Appraisal Strategy is a key factor affecting both project drivers and project outcomes.
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Generally, asset developments are characterised by a Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive approach, depending on the completeness and quality of the subsurface data that are being used in the project. Each approach has implications for the risks and benefits that are carried forward into project execution.  "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,The Angsi 3D seismic data used were from 1995 and were reprocessed in 2000. In
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"August 2004, one appraisal well penetrated the reservoir I-27/35U. This appraisal well supplied fluid content, structure, stratigraphy, core, and pressure MDT data. At sanction, the data available were from one appraisal well and from wells drilled in the Angsi Field in previous phases. Therefore, given the size of the field, the number of the wells penetrated, and the subsurface data available, the Angsi-D Development Project had an Aggressive appraisal strategy. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Areas of risk include uncertainty associated with the structure across the field. I-100  reservoir was penetrated by Angsi-8 and rest of the reservoirs (I-15L, I-75, I-85) were appraised  using the information from previous wells drilling in Angsi Field. SUBSURFACE COMPLEXITY"
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,Reservoir Complexity and Wells Complexity are used to assess the subsurface conditions and characteristics of the wells programs used in asset development projects. Higher complexity ratings can increase project risks. The following two sections describe the complexity rating and issues that affected the Angsi-D Development Project. 
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,Reservoir Complexity
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"The Reservoir Complexity Index (RCI) for the Angsi-D reservoirs is 36, which is similar to the average PCSB RCI of 37; the industry average RCI is 39.

The other reservoirs are similar; however, the main differences are the reservoir energy is higher and the I-100 reservoir has high stacking. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Wells Complexity The production wells are more complex than industry average and are similar to the PCSB averages. The Angsi-D wells consist of 11 wells and 5 optional wells. There are 10  producer wells, 3 gas injector wells, and 3 water injector wells. The Wells Complexity Index  (WCI) for the 11 wells ranges from 52 to 55; industry average is 52 and the PCSB average is 49. The team had to design the wells to incorporate possible adverse gases and low mud weight. The completion designs include gas lift, formation evaluation and logging, but do not include  sand controls. The original well designs were for single-string and dual-string completion. Some  wells have angles of more than 70 degrees. FRONT-END LOADING"
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Front-End Loading (FEL) is a measure of the definition of a project; FEL provides a picture of the project’s readiness for execution and level of risk and is a major driver of project outcomes. IPA determines the Asset FEL Index, a measure of the project’s overall level of definition, by considering together the FEL indices for three E&P disciplines: (1) Reservoir FEL, (2) Wells FEL, and (3) Facilities FEL.

2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Value Improving Practices (VIPs) are disciplined practices that tend to improve the value of capital projects in the process industries. Certain VIPs are more suited to particular disciplines, although our research has shown benefit from applying the others comprehensively across the whole asset. "
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Successful VIPs application requires a formal, disciplined, and documented approach  with measurable results. For VIPs to have a positive effect on project outcomes, the project  must achieve an advanced level of project definition. Implementing VIPs with below average FEL effectively eliminates the benefits of their use; when FEL is incomplete, project changes  that occur as definition continues alter the basis of the project, thereby eroding the benefits of  having used the VIP. IPA research has revealed the statistical significance of all of the above driver metrics in  affecting project outcomes. EXECUTION DISCIPLINE METRICS The measurement of execution discipline is complex. IPA focuses on a simple set of  execution discipline metrics, which are cost effective to collect, including project manager  continuity, the Project Control Index (PCI), and late design changes. Other elements of execution discipline can be captured through a “lessons learned”  process. IPA routinely conducts Lessons Learned Workshops in conjunction with closeout  interviews to help teams identify practices to apply to future projects—the real transferable  lessons learned. OUTCOME METRICS IPA has developed a comprehensive set of models that allow a top-down analysis of  project costs and schedules. The costs include project definition, project management,  engineering, materials, installation, and commissioning. The highest level cost benchmark is based on capital cost per barrel for facilities and  drilling. The models compare the project with the industry average capital expenditure per barrel  of oil equivalent ($/BOE). CONFIDENTIAL VII IPA The next level looks at a facilities program cost (concept unspecific), i.e., a benchmark  of the total non-export facility costs. To compare projects consistently, export costs are always  excluded from this metric. On a more detailed level, we benchmark the cost of individual project components,  such as platforms and pipelines. We assess the contingency required for the facilities as a percentage of the base  estimate. We analyse the project’s overall schedule performance. Predictability of project outcomes is also important, so IPA measures both cost and  schedule predictability, as ratios of the outcomes to planned targets. OPERABILITY/PRODUCTION ATTAINMENT METRICS Completing a project predictably fast at low cost will not benefit the business unless it  operates satisfactorily, and anticipated value is realised."
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"IPA evaluates the degree to which life-of-project production stream estimates change during the execution and early production stages of the project, as further reservoir evaluation and early reservoir management change the perception of the reservoir. The drawback with this measure is that the ultimate production stream not known until the end of field life. Furthermore, production stream re-estimation is a time-consuming process. Therefore, often teams do not undertake such an exercise from project sanction until sufficient dynamic reservoir performance data have been gathered, which is often months or even years into field life.

CONFIDENTIAL XIV IPA APPENDIX F: VALUE IMPROVING PRACTICES APPLICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF VIPS"
2009 Angsi D Dev CLO (Final).pdf,"Each of the Value Improving Practices (VIPs) is defined below. However, these definitions do not explain the requirements for successful VIPs application. Successful VIPs application requires a formal, disciplined, and documented approach with measurable results: • The VIP activities must be scheduled and resourced early during a project's life cycle for these practices to have their maximum effect on project costs. Moreover, resources must be set aside so that the practices may be satisfactorily implemented, perhaps even using individuals external to the project to oversee the application. • The VIP activities must be done thoroughly. For example, ensuring that a project employs the best available technology—the goal of the Technology Selection VIP—requires identification of potential candidates through rigorous patent searches, visits to university research centers and process licensors, and the subsequent evaluation of these candidates. Thorough application of this VIP means that the potential candidates cannot be limited to only those of whom the firm is currently aware. • The VIP must be applied to the full scope of the project (at least initially). Arbitrarily limiting the scope to a portion of the project unnecessarily limits the practices' potential effects. • Guidelines must exist to ensure that each VIP is applied consistently, i.e., which costs should be evaluated (e.g., total life cycle cost) and which economic and financial assumptions should be used. • The results of VIPs application must be documented. Documentation is performed to provide a basis for the project team to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the practice and to provide lessons learned for future project teams. At a minimum, the following information should be recorded: a description of the activity, the monetary value of the scope work reviewed, the monetary savings achieved, and the cost of applying each VIP.

Project control is a process whereby effective cost and schedule performance baseline plans are established (planning, estimating, and scheduling), measurements of performance against the plan are made and evaluated (progressing and forecasting), and corrective action is taken (change management) when measures indicate a deviation from the plan is occurring or is likely to occur.

2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,"At the component level, the pipeline cost is similar to Industry. The facilities costs were benchmarked using Upstream Cost Engineering Committee (UCEC19) metrics because the hydrocarbon throughput for the J4DR-A platform is small relative to the wellhead platforms (WHPs) in our WHP cost model. Therefore, the platform benchmark should be interpreted with caution, as the cost index provided in Table 1 does not take into account variables such as water depth, maximum wave height, hydrocarbon throughput, and number of slots. Based on the UCEC weight metrics, the jacket and topside costs are more expensive than projects in "

2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,"The J4 Development Project objective was to develop the J4 oil field with a 4-legged drilling platform and drill 6 development wells to recover oil from J4. The full well stream (FWS) was to be sent to the D35 platform, about 53 km away. The business mandated that the project achieve first oil by July 2008. "
2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,"Overall, the project achieved its objectives but did not reach first oil until October 2008  with approximately 7 percent asset cost growth. The wells program has slipped the planned  schedule by 16 percent. The drilling cost estimate at sanction has grown from US$78 million to US$91 million. Overall the project increased the recoverable volume by 56 percent (or 21 MMBOE). FIELD DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY The hydrocarbon accumulation is contained in four stacked reservoir units composed of  fluvial clastics of the Miocene Cycle II stratigraphic sequence. The field forms a structurally  complex anticline subdivided into several fault blocks, three of which are proven oil-bearing. The main drive mechanism is expected to be solution gas and gas cap. A peak oil rate of 5,000 barrels per day (bpd) is expected. In view of the light crude (41° API gravity), increasing  gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) and low-water cut, development wells are expected to be capable of  sustaining natural flow throughout the 9-year production life. PROJECT SCOPE"
2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,"The J4 Development Project scope includes the following elements: • An unmanned wellhead platform (WHP), J4DR-A, consisting of a four-legged steel template jacket. J4DR-A was configured with 12 x 660-mm diameter (or 26-inch) conductor slots. Six slots will be utilised for J4 development while the rest are provisions for future development.  • The drilling program at sanction was to drill 8 (2 horizontal and 6 deviated) development wells and 1 appraisal well to the adjacent section, which is divided by a fault. After an optimisation study during the execution phase, the drilling scope was reduced to 6 development wells and 1 appraisal well.  • An intrafield pipeline, 10 inch x 53 km carbon steel (from J4DR-A to D35 riser platform) was installed.

This section provides the results of our analysis of the key project drivers listed below:  • Appraisal philosophy • Subsurface complexity • Level of definition (or Front-End Loading) • Team Development Index (TDI) • Use of applicable Value Improving Practices (VIPs) "
2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,APPRAISAL PHILOSOPHY Appraisal Strategy is a key factor affecting both project drivers and project outcomes.
2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,"Generally, asset developments are characterised by a Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive approach, depending on the completeness and quality of the subsurface data that are being used in the project. Each approach has implications for the risks and benefits that are carried forward into project execution.  "
2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,"The J4 Development Project had a Moderate appraisal philosophy that was conducted by Shell. The data were handed over to PCSB after the field lease expired. 3D seismic was used to underpin the reservoirs, but the seismic was shot over 20 years ago, processed in 1985 and reprocessed in 1992 by PCSB. The seismic image was clear, but no velocity data were available from Shell to provide inversion analysis. An exploration well and four appraisal wells were drilled and completed in J4. Log data were available for each well and core samples were taken from four wells. Pressure and fluid samples were also taken in the J4 field. Production data were also available through DSTs on two wells, which were tested for about 24 hours each. Therefore, given the small field, appropriate number of wells penetrated, and subsurface data available, the J4 Development Project is classified as having a Moderate appraisal strategy.  "

The team had to design the wells to incorporate possible shallow hazards and adverse gases, and tectonic stresses. The completion designs include gas lift and sand controls.

Therefore, a number of wells will be completed as dual completion strings. Moreover, the casing designs were found to be inadequate; the team had tried to save costs by reducing the cement used. The casing changes cost the team an additional US$2.5 million per well for the five remaining wells.

The J4 Development Project had better than industry average project definition and had  moderate targets for cost. The project team achieved sound results in competitiveness and  predictability. However, the execution schedule was aggressive, driven by the first oil date. Team integration and industry-proven technology benefited the young, relatively inexperienced,  team members.

Most of the design had already been  completed from the Angsi Project, and the J4 team was able to modify them to suit the J4 environment. This approach was much faster than the time the team would have  needed to start the J4 design from scratch, and was especially helpful given the project’s  time constraints. 3. Adequate project controls and proactive contractor management kept the project aligned  with business and project objectives.

2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,"Value Improving Practices (VIPs) are disciplined practices that tend to improve the value of capital projects in the process industries. Certain VIPs are more suited to particular disciplines, although our research has shown benefit from applying the others comprehensively across the whole asset. "
2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,"Successful VIPs application requires a formal, disciplined, and documented approach  with measurable results. For VIPs to have a positive effect on project outcomes, the project  must achieve an advanced level of project definition. Implementing VIPs with below average FEL effectively eliminates the benefits of their use; when FEL is incomplete, project changes  that occur as definition continues alter the basis of the project, thereby eroding the benefits of  having used the VIP. IPA research has revealed the statistical significance of all of the above driver metrics in  affecting project outcomes. EXECUTION DISCIPLINE METRICS The measurement of execution discipline is complex. IPA focuses on a simple set of  execution discipline metrics, which are cost effective to collect, including project manager  continuity, the Project Control Index (PCI), and late design changes. Other elements of execution discipline can be captured through a “lessons learned”  process. IPA routinely conducts Lessons Learned Workshops in conjunction with closeout  interviews to help teams identify practices to apply to future projects—the real transferable  lessons learned. OUTCOME METRICS IPA has developed a comprehensive set of models that allow a top-down analysis of  project costs and schedules. The costs include project definition, project management,  engineering, materials, installation, and commissioning. The highest level cost benchmark is based on capital cost per barrel for facilities and  drilling. The models compare the project with the industry average capital expenditure per barrel  of oil equivalent ($/BOE). CONFIDENTIAL VII IPA The next level looks at a facilities program cost (concept unspecific), i.e., a benchmark  of the total non-export facility costs. To compare projects consistently, export costs are always  excluded from this metric. On a more detailed level, we benchmark the cost of individual project components,  such as platforms and pipelines. We assess the contingency required for the facilities as a percentage of the base  estimate. We analyse the project’s overall schedule performance. Predictability of project outcomes is also important, so IPA measures both cost and  schedule predictability, as ratios of the outcomes to planned targets. OPERABILITY/PRODUCTION ATTAINMENT METRICS Completing a project predictably fast at low cost will not benefit the business unless it  operates satisfactorily, and anticipated value is realised."
2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,"IPA evaluates the degree to which life-of-project production stream estimates change during the execution and early production stages of the project, as further reservoir evaluation and early reservoir management change the perception of the reservoir. The drawback with this measure is that the ultimate production stream not known until the end of field life. Furthermore, production stream re-estimation is a time-consuming process. Therefore, often teams do not undertake such an exercise from project sanction until sufficient dynamic reservoir performance data have been gathered, which is often months or even years into field life. "
2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,"As a more tangible proxy for field performance, IPA now puts more emphasis on  production attainment, the ratio of actual production in the second 6 months of operation (to  allow for a settling in period and adjusted for schedule slips) compared to the production profile  planned at sanction.

2009 J4 CLO (Final).pdf,"Each of the Value Improving Practices (VIPs) is defined below. However, these definitions do not explain the requirements for successful VIPs application. Successful VIPs application requires a formal, disciplined, and documented approach with measurable results: • The VIP activities must be scheduled and resourced early during a project's life cycle for these practices to have their maximum effect on project costs. Moreover, resources must be set aside so that the practices may be satisfactorily implemented, perhaps even using individuals external to the project to oversee the application. • The VIP activities must be done thoroughly. For example, ensuring that a project employs the best available technology—the goal of the Technology Selection VIP—requires identification of potential candidates through rigorous patent searches, visits to university research centers and process licensors, and the subsequent evaluation of these candidates. Thorough application of this VIP means that the potential candidates cannot be limited to only those of whom the firm is currently aware. • The VIP must be applied to the full scope of the project (at least initially). Arbitrarily limiting the scope to a portion of the project unnecessarily limits the practices' potential effects. • Guidelines must exist to ensure that each VIP is applied consistently, i.e., which costs should be evaluated (e.g., total life cycle cost) and which economic and financial assumptions should be used. • The results of VIPs application must be documented. Documentation is performed to provide a basis for the project team to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the practice and to provide lessons learned for future project teams.

The objective of project control is to establish and maintain a disciplined approach to managing work activities during execution so that planned project outcomes are achieved. Project control is a process whereby effective cost and schedule performance baseline plans are established (planning, estimating, and scheduling), measurements of performance against the plan are made and evaluated (progressing and forecasting), and corrective action is taken (change management) when measures indicate a deviation from the plan is occurring or is likely to occur.

A strong control basis supports the achievement of Best Practical FEL. During project execution, project control focuses on measurement and reporting of progress, forecasting, and change management. The PCI quantifies the strength of the planned or actual practices. In a postsanction or closeout analysis, measures of the actual practices used during execution are substituted for what was planned during FEL. Planning without follow-through during execution will not result in the project outcomes desired. Table 23 shows the components of the PCI for closeout analyses. "

As KHL did not have a fabrication yard in the area, a yard was rented from Oceancare in Labuan. The project team improved the safety signage at the yard and, together with the contractor, implemented PCSB’s safety policies at the yard. Around this time, the team was informed that a rig from a PCSB field in Vietnam would be available in February 2011.

The team again conducted a lesson learned review after each well, helping to keep the overall drilling campaign on schedule. The overall non-productive time on the drilling programme was lower than expected. The team used a decision tree process, which allowed the drillers to make decisions offshore and continue working. In addition, some completion offshore support vessels that the team had originally planned to use were not available, but this did not affect the project because the support vessels were ultimately not needed. The rig contract also expired midway through drilling campaign and the day rate changed from US$180,000 per day to US$120,000 per day. A delay that was outside the team’s control occurred at the completion of the campaign; rig demobilisation was delayed by 2 days when the tug boat transporting it was late.

The change in benchmark is due to an update in the model since that time. The previous model predicted wells program durations by comparing overall program characteristics such as number of wells, number of re-used wells and average wells complexity. The updated model predicts drilling and completion durations for each well. The drivers of these durations are described above.

IPA evaluates project control as measured by the Project Control Index (PCI); the incidence of key team member turnover; and the frequency  and effect of major late changes. Table 9 summarises the project execution discipline for the Samarang Phase 1 Project. The Samarang Phase 1 Project used control plans that were  better than both Industry and PCSB averages. The project had no major changes in the  wells or the facilities scope. There were no project manager turnovers.

2012 Samarang Ph 1 CLO (Final) .pdf,"CONFIDENTIAL 18 IPA research shows that projects with strong project cost and schedule control practices have less cost growth and schedule slip, and fewer late changes. During project definition, project control supports the achievement of Best Practical FEL by establishing effective cost and schedule control baselines. During execution, project control maintains cost and schedule discipline to ensure that planned outcomes are achieved. The benefits of good FEL can be significantly eroded by poor project control practices during execution.  "
2012 Samarang Ph 1 CLO (Final) .pdf,The PCI includes two components: (1) estimating for control and (2) control during  execution. Below we discuss the status of each component for the Samarang Phase 1
2012 Samarang Ph 1 CLO (Final) .pdf,"Project. • Estimating for Control: This element of the PCI measures how definitive project estimating methods were and how the estimate quality and effectiveness were validated. We found that the Samarang Phase 1 Project’s estimating methods were sufficiently definitive for all cost categories to support effective project control. The project estimate was integrated with the project schedule. The estimate basis document was published. The estimate was consistent with the latest design documents. Facilities and drilling estimates were based on the same scope and concepts. The estimate was quantitatively validated by an in-house estimating specialist using in-house metrics. • Control During Execution: This element of the PCI measures the extent to which physical progressing was used, the extent of project status/progress reporting, and whether an owner project control specialist was assigned to the project. It also includes whether cost data were captured in a database for future planning. The Samarang Phase 1 Project used comprehensive physical progressing methods during execution. Most work breakdown structure (WBS) activities had physical measures associated with them. Project management reviewed detailed progress updates. Project status/progress reports were prepared on a weekly basis at a summary and detailed level. All elements of execution were covered in the report (engineering, fabrication, transportation and installation, hook-up and commissioning, and drilling). The reports covered both cost and schedule. Progress reports covered the overall progress of the project. "

2012 Samarang Ph 1 CLO (Final) .pdf,"The Samarang Phase 1 Project followed other practices that drove effective project control. The project manager and senior team members conducted regular meetings armed with earned value/cost analysis and ensured that team members understood the project status well and its direction at any time. Similarly, they interacted with the contractor’s team and made sure that the contractor followed the earned value analysis along with the schedule and resource analysis. Monthly/weekly updates of all the analysis were posted on a notice board for team awareness. Monthly offshore health safety & environment (HSE) management visits were done during drilling, hook-up, and commissioning (HUC). These practices helped to resolve any outstanding issues at the worksite. Daily meetings were held at the office and offshore during drilling operations.  "

Using the PETRONAS project process, the PPMS, to guide its work, the team achieved optimal FEL prior to authorisation. The team followed through with good project controls. Together, these practices enabled the team to avoid design changes in execution. By contrast, 75 percent of recent PCSB projects have experienced late design changes.  "

The Moderate appraisal strategy highlights the remaining risks and uncertainty in estimated recoverable volumes given the seismic quality, reservoir complexity, and data quality. "

Team identified these risks and plans were put in place to mitigate. The Facilities FEL was Good, which is better than the industry and PETRONAS averages. This rating is better than the rating given during the prospective evaluation (Poor) because the Facilities FEL at the prospective evaluation was a result of the Poor rating for the greenfield scope (EOR program).

This plan was followed through during execution. The team actively managed the HUC contractor in both onshore and offshore activities. Team representatives were at the contractor yard and on platforms to track and monitor progress, qualities, and safety. Progress was reported monthly at discipline levels. A cost control and a planner were assigned during project execution. In addition to a detailed planned project control, “Control Room” application was established in 2011 to assist the process of monitoring and tracking project progress and performance so that risks could be prevented and mitigated at timely manner. The “Control "

This “Control Room” application enables all stakeholders and team members aligned on project risks,  project status and performance. Furthermore, when risks are registered centrally, risks are  better prioritized, critical risks are better assigned to track and action. Major Late Changes A change is defined as a deviation from the project’s planned configuration,  objectives, or desired functionality. Changes can be grouped under design or scope  changes.

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 CLO (Final).pdf,"The project’s objective was to develop the F9, Kumang, and Kanowit gas fields with a  total gas and condensate reserve of 309 MMBOE8 from 11 wells. First gas was planned to  flow from F9 with Kumang and Kanowit to follow until project completion, planned on 12 December 2010. The project achieved first gas on 31 August 2011 from F9, 10.5 months later than  planned. The Kumang field came online 6 May 2012, and the Kanowit field started production"

However, the Kanowit subsea system experienced several subsea leaks and was required to shut down because of higher than expected reservoir temperatures that the subsea system had not been designed to handle. The project was therefore not completed when it was handed over to operations on 30 June 2013. "
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 CLO (Final).pdf,"The project’s forecast final cost is RM6.9 billion, however project accounts are  expected to be closed at the end of December 2014, which is after this analysis’ completion. The project’s total man hours was just in excess of 14 million, in which four lost time  injuries (LTIs) and 25 recordable injuries were recorded. Post start-up reserves estimates indicated reserves downgrades on F9 and Kanowit  but a reserve increase on Kumang, resulting in a net loss in reserves of 6 percent to 284 MMBOE. Reservoir performance on F9 was most disappointing with the early onset of water  production. In order to make up for production shortfalls, a further two infill wells are planned  to be drilled in 2015. PROJECT BACKGROUND Kumang Cluster fields are located approximately 200 km offshore Bintulu, Sarawak,  with water depths ranging from 59 m to 102 m in sub-blocks SK 308, 313, and 315. Kumang Cluster gas fields, at the time of project sanction consisted of ten (10) gas reservoirs: Kanowit, F9, Kumang, F22, F12, F27, F11, A3, Selar Marine, and Bunga Pelaga. These reservoirs were  planned to be developed in two phases. Phase 1 development consists of Kanowit, F9, and Kumang fields East section only (the West section was planned for Phase 2). The total  resource promise for all reservoirs was about 2.7 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas, to be recovered  by 23 development wells. Current plans for further development are limited to infill drilling on F9 only with other prospects failing to meet economic hurdle rates due to lower reserves  expectations. Since then six more fields have been added with an estimated ultimate recovery  of 6.6 Tcf. Further development is planned as follows: - Phase 2a:  F9 south, F12, Anjung, Anjung south - Phase 2b:  F22, NC4, NC10, F2 Attic (subject to further review) - Phase 3:  F27, A3 Selar Marine 8 MMBOE = Million barrel of oil equivalent CONFIDENTIAL 4 IPA"

The total reserve for all ten fields was on the order of 2.7 trillion square cubic feet (Tcf) gas, to be recovered from 23 development wells and 9 reservoirs including: F9 north, Kumang, F11, F12, F22, F27, A3, Selar Marine and Bunga Pelaga.    A Production Sharing Contract (PSC) was signed in September 2005. PETRONAS  provided PCSB an opportunity to develop these fields to provide supply security to the MLNG plant in Bintulu in anticipation of gas shortfall by 2010. Kumang Cluster will be  developed to meet the PSC requirement of 350 MMscfd for the first year and 500 MMscfd for following years.    The project commenced 1 February 2006, and a concept engineering study was  awarded to MMC Oil and Gas Sdn. Bhd. on 24 July 2006 and completed 22 December 2006.    Milestone reviews 3 and 4 (MR3 & MR4) were held 22 March 2007 to endorse the  development concept and economics which included wellhead platforms on Kumang, Kanowit, and F9 with the central processing platform located at F9.    The original overall contracting strategy was presented to Petronas and approved 30"

Subsea projects that are integrated with a larger project development typically experience greater schedule slip and cost growth than standalone subsea development projects. IPA Research performed in 2003 and presented at the annual Upstream Industry Benchmarking Conference found that subsea developments that were part of an integrated project experienced greater cost volatility and schedule slip than standalone subsea tie-back projects and particularly suffered when combined with poor levels of definition prior to project authorisation. The research is briefly summarised in Appendix II. The KUCL1 subsea component experienced late changes as a result of poor basic data and limited FEED compounded with the lack of a comprehensive project execution plan which led to requirements for new technology leading to schedule slip and cost growth and most importantly lower production than planned.

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"This report evaluates the project definition of the Kumang Cluster Phase 1 Project, which is being executed in Malaysia. Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB2) operates the fields under an existing production-sharing contract (PSC) with PETRONAS (Government). Kumang Cluster fields are 100 percent PCSB equity. "
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"Kumang Cluster fields are located approximately 200 km offshore Bintulu, Sarawak, with  water depths ranging from 59 m to 102 m in sub-block SK 308, 313, and 315.

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"A preliminary resource assessment carried out by PCSB using PETRONAS Management Unit (PMU3) data and available maps was presented and endorsed by PCSB Management on 15 April 2005. The total resource promise for all 10 fields is about 2.7 trillion  cubic feet (tcf) of gas, to be recovered by 23 development wells. In September 2005, the PSC for the Kumang Cluster development was signed."
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,PETRONAS provided PCSB an opportunity to develop these fields to ensure security of supply to the MLNG plant in Bintulu in anticipation of a gas shortfall by 2010. Kumang Cluster Phase 1 will be developed to meet the PSC requirement of 350 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) for the first year and 500 mmscfd for subsequent years. It is anticipated that the gas in the Kumang Cluster fields (phase 1 and phase 2) will supply for 15 years.  
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"The proposed scope for the Kumang Cluster Phase 1 Project is to install a central processing platform (CPP) located at Kanowit. The gas and condensate will be separated, dehydrated, and compressed prior to transportation to the onshore MLNG terminal 2 through a dedicated two-phase 180 km trunkline.  "
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"To meet the maximum production target of 500 mmscfd, 11 wells are planned to be drilled. Kanowit field has two deviated subsea wells tied back to the Kanowit CPP. The F9 field will be drilled with 4 deviated platform wells. The Kumang field will be drained with 5 horizontal platform wells. The ultimate recovery and the recovery factors are estimated based on dynamic modeling using Eclipse. The Kanowit, Kumang, and F9 fields have an estimated recovery of 525 billion cubic feet (bcf), 384 bcf, and 663 bcf of gas, respectively.  "

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"To date, the project team faced several challenges during the project concept and definition phase, in particular, (1) having to pursue an Aggressive appraisal due to the pressure to achieve first gas by 2010, (2) the scope change from a WHP in Kanowit to subsea tieback as decided by PCSB management, and (3) the constrained resource market. These challenges have impeded the project definition phase and may result in poor execution outcomes.  "

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"This report presents our evaluation of the Kumang Cluster Phase 1 Project’s level of definition, as well as an evaluation of the cost, schedule, and performance risks associated with the development. The business objective for the Kumang Cluster Phase 1 Project field in location is to supply gas to the MLNG plant in Bintulu by 2010.  "
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"At the time of the interview, the project was approaching project sanction tier 2 (or full- funds authorization), which is planned for September 2008, when the plan for development and  operations will be submitted to the authorities. First production is anticipated in October 2010. Total cost for the Kumang Cluster Phase 1 Project is US$1,466 million. The Kumang Cluster Phase 1 Project is being executed in Malaysia. Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB15) operates the fields under an existing production-sharing contract (PSC) with PETRONAS. Kumang Cluster fields are 100 percent PCSB equity. Kumang Cluster fields are located approximately 200 km offshore Bintulu, Sarawak, with  water depths ranging from 59 m to 102 m in subblock SK 308, 313, and 315. Kumang Cluster  gas fields consist of total 10 fields, namely Kanowit, F9, Kumang, F22, F12, F27, F11, A3, Selar Marine, and Bunga Pelaga. These fields will be developed in two phases. Phase 1 development  will consist of Kanowit, F9, and Kumang fields East section only (the West section is planned for Phase 2). The remaining fields will be developed in the next phase to meet the continuing gas  demand. A preliminary resource assessment carried out by PCSB using Petronas Management Unit (PMU16) data and available maps was presented and endorsed by PCSB Management on 15 April 2005. The total resource promise for all 10 fields is about 2.7 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of  gas, to be recovered by 23 development wells. In September 2005, the PSC for the Kumang Cluster development was signed."
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,PETRONAS provided PCSB an opportunity to develop these fields to ensure security of supply to the MLNG plant in Bintulu in anticipation of a gas shortfall by 2010. Kumang Cluster Phase 1 will be developed to meet the PSC requirement of 350 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) for the first year and 500 mmscfd for subsequent years. It is anticipated that the gas supply in the Kumang Cluster fields (phase 1 and phase 2) will last for 15 years.  
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"The proposed scope for the Kumang Cluster Phase 1 Project is to install a central processing platform (CPP) located at Kanowit.

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"Kumang field is a combination of stratigraphic and structural play with a northwest- southeast trending structure, and overlaid by Cycle V/VI clastic stratigraphics, located within the Central Luconia Province. The structure encompasses an area of approximately 20 X 10 sq. km It was mapped on vintage 3D seismic survey with good seismic reflection quality down to the  top of the sandstone. Kumang was discovered by PMU drilling Kumang-1 exploration well  encountering about 56 ft (17 m) of gas column in SC3 sand, and 12 ft (3.5 m) of gas column in SC3A sand of Cycle V/VI. Two production tests were conducted in Kumang-1. In October 2005, Kumang-2 appraisal well was drilled by PMU to firm up the volumetric assessment, appraise the  reservoir quality, and determine distribution of the Top Cycle V/VI detached sand body. A total 9.5 m of net gas was found in SC3 reservoir. No production test was conducted in Kumang-2. Current development of Kumang field is based on a drilling reach limitation focused on Kumang SC3 sand in the eastern part of the field. PROJECT SCOPE AND DEPLETION PLAN"

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,CONTRACTING STRATEGY
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"The project’s contracting strategy was originally a lump-sum engineer, procure, construction, and commission (EPCC). However, in July 2007, near the end of FEED, the contracting strategy changed to lump-sum procure, construction, and commission (PCC), because PCSB senior management wanted to pursue synergies between projects. Therefore, a few major projects with similar concepts and similar first gas date were bundled together; the fabrication yards were getting busy, and management could secure those yards by integrating  "
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"CONFIDENTIAL 16 IPA   several projects. This bundling strategy would therefore allow PCSB to direct negotiate (as  opposed to competitive bidding) with the fabrication yard contractors. From July 2007 onward, the team commenced preparing the rollover contract for Ranhill"
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"Worley from FEED to detailed engineering (DE). The PCC tender package was also being prepared at this time. A task force was formed by PCSB to coordinate the contracting packages under the bundling strategy. The team presented the final contracting package to management for approval in late 2007. However, management had questioned why the team did not use the existing umbrella contract for commissioning. Therefore, the contracting strategy was rejected and was changed to a procure and construct (PC) lump-sum contract with commissioning done under the existing umbrella contract.  "
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"The team had planned to install all components by October 2009 before the monsoon season, which would enable the project to achieve first gas by June 2010. However, the direct negotiation approach (which was expected to take less time) took longer than expected and, in fact, is now longer than the expected time if competitive bidding had been used.  "
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"The PC bundling package was presented to the Central Tender Committee (CTC) in August 2008, and was then endorsed. The PETRONAS Board had also approved of the  package. At the time of the interview, the contracting package was waiting for the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to approve, which is expected in late September 2008."
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"The TAD and semisubmersible rigs have been contracted and scheduled for the drilling program. The actual rig to perform the drilling has not been identified. The joint efforts between the Drilling Department and Master Integrated Schedule (MIS) group has a placeholder for the drilling program and will allocate a suitable rig according to the specifications provided by the team. The semisubmersible rig rate is currently being negotiated. The team has estimated the rig rate to be approximately US$200,000 per day based on market intelligence. The TAD rig is contracted for US$129,000 per day. "

IPA conducts research into upstream megaprojects. For insight into this class of projects, we examined 14 very large field developments—11 offshore—that were completed in the last 10 years. The sample deliberately excludes tar sands and extra heavy oil developments, so the results are not distorted by the inclusion of unconventional resources. In addition, the sample is not overly represented by projects that used new technology and none experienced major scope changes in the subsurface scope of work. Most of the projects were executed in regions with existing hydrocarbon production facilities; only two of the projects were executed in frontier regions. "

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"Generally, asset developments are characterized by a Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive approach, depending on the completeness and quality of the subsurface data that are being used in the project. Each approach has implications for the risks and benefits that are carried forward into project execution. It is understood that project teams may not necessarily be able to control the quality of the appraisal data in all cases; nevertheless, poor quality data, for whatever reason, indicates a remaining risk or uncertainty that should be reflected in the sanction RPE/production profile.  "
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"An effective appraisal program will materially increase the reliability of the reservoir  production estimate for a given asset development. To characterize an appraisal program’s  effectiveness in increasing the reliability of the RPE associated with the Kumang Cluster Phase 1 Project, we collect information on five factors: reservoir complexity; quality of seismic imaging;  reservoir properties; geologic properties; and fluid properties."
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"The Kumang Cluster Phase 1 Project has an Aggressive appraisal philosophy. Core, pressure, and fluid samples were taken in the Kumang, Kanowit, and F9 fields. 2D seismic was also used to underpin the reservoirs. The Kanowit field had no appraisal wells but only one exploration well. The F9 and Kumang East field has two appraisal wells. Given the minimal time to appraise the fields and hence limited subsurface data, the Kumang Cluster Phase 1 Project faces significant subsurface uncertainties.  "
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"RESERVOIR FRONT-END LOADING Front-End Loading (FEL) is a measure of the level of definition of a project. FEL is a  major driver of project outcomes; therefore FEL provides a picture of the project’s readiness for  execution and level of risk. IPA measures FEL for three E&P disciplines: (1) Reservoir FEL, (2) Wells FEL, and (3) Facilities FEL. For the FEL discussion in the following sections, the  assessments were made at the end of FEL 3 which will allow a more consistent benchmark with Industry. Moreover, when the discussion in the following FEL sections refer to project sanction,  for the Kumang Cluster Phase 1, this means at the end of FEL 3 or near project sanction (Tier 1) in the new project management process, which is a few months after the end of FEL 3."

There was one major constraint, however, that the project team had during the subsurface evaluation phase: the timing to conduct the subsurface evaluation. The forecasted 2010 gas shortage at the MLNG plant meant that Petronas was required to investigate alternative gas supplies, therefore artificially creating a first gas deadline by 2010 to meet the shortfall. Therefore, given the time constraints, the project team had little time to adequately complete the subsurface activities, which include activities from the appraisal phase. Consequently, the FDP was not completed in time for approval by the Petronas board, and was instead conditionally approved pending the completion of the 3D seismic interpretation, core analysis, and subsea scope development.

This was a business and commercial strategic decision made by PMU to reduce cost and to increase the subsea knowledge in Petronas as a possible solution to deepwater and marginal field developments. The late scope change meant that the subsurface team had to reevaluate the surface location and well trajectories.

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"The Kumang Cluster Phase 1 Project facilities team will be implementing subsea technology in Kanowit. Although subsea has been used in the industry for some time, it is the first time Petronas has designed and executed subsea kits. As mentioned previously, the subsea scope was added to the phase 1 development in August 2007 during FEL 3. The subsea scope was a replacement of a WHP in Kanowit. This strategic decision made by PMU was to increase PCSB’s subsea capabilities and to reduce cost in the field development. It is envisaged that future tiebacks will be conducted using subsea technology. Petronas is currently developing and reviewing a frame agreement with several subsea contractors. The subsea contract will be divided into two sections: subsea hardware, and subsea umbilical. The subsea team leading this scope has no prior subsea experience and will therefore be obtaining guidance from Petronas’ international projects community, Shell Malaysia, and external subsea consultants. It has been mandated by Petronas management that all documents, costs, and schedule for the subsea scope be reviewed by external subsea experts. We therefore rate this use of technology as Limited.

For the given jacket weight, the Kumang Cluster Phase 1 team is paying slightly more for the structure. However, the team is  paying slightly less for the topside for a given topside weight when compared to other projects in Asia. Overall, the KUJT-A and F9JT-A platforms costs are, respectively, 9 percent and 6  percent less costly than other Asia projects.

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"Malaysian waters. The decision to replace the original WHP concept in Kanowit with subsea was aimed at reducing cost and gaining experience in installing subsea. PCSB is planning to execute more subsea in the future and will need to build its subsea capabilities. The subsea kit chosen by PCSB has lowered costs in the overall project estimate if compared with other WHP platforms (assuming the original WHP would have similar costs)–ignoring the number of slots as a variable. However, when compared with other similar subsea projects, KASS is more expensive. This could be partly explained by the team’s choice of a high-pressure protection system that would drive cost savings by reducing the topsides equipment or lowing the rating of the riser system. Higher subsea costs could also be partly explained by the lack of cost detail, such as escalation, in the estimate. Embedded escalation, if not extracted out, will lead to a higher cost index. Finally, the high-level cost estimate provided by the team did not include project management team cost or transportation costs. These cost elements could be also embedded in other line items; however, if this is not the case, then the subsea cost may be underestimated if escalation can be removed.   "

Megaprojects, even  the successful ones, are difficult projects. The megaproject failures and successes differed in important ways in terms of the team  size, team integration, level of project definition at authorization, use of VIPs, and contracting  approaches.

Megaprojects are no different than other projects in needing to set outcomes that are realistic and are supported by the level of definition of the project drivers. Well defined megaprojects should be setting industry average cost and schedule targets. Setting aggressive targets introduces unnecessary risk to the inherent vulnerability of megaprojects.

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,CONFIDENTIAL VII IPA • Schedule pressures. Our research shows that nearly all megaprojects become schedule driven at some stage in their execution. The pressure to advance the project’s completion date or to maintain the authorized date despite the project’s progress falling behind plan typically becomes intense during construction. The best megaprojects resist changes to the original project schedule and execution plans. 
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,Such changes require the schedule and all its interrelated activities to be rearranged  and the various vendors and contractors to change the sequence of their work.
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"Attempts to change construction plans are often accompanied by poorer work productivity, weaker supervision, and an increase in safety incidents. A characteristic of some of the megaprojects with the highest cost growth—40 percent or more—is an attempt to advance schedule progress in the face of a hot or constrained labor market. The best megaprojects work to the installation sequencing established through the rigorous and detailed schedule planning done prior to detailed engineering. Educating management on the implications of increasing schedule priority is an important concept. Early contingency or scenario planning can build buy-in early about what to do should the project fall behind schedule or if the team receives pressure to advance or arbitrarily hold project completion dates.

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"PSC) and it is important for the project team to engage management and other stakeholders early to ensure expectations are aligned, especially if the project falls behind schedule. Monitoring this progress will mean that the team needs to have developed a robust schedule and project controls process with contractors.   • External stakeholders, community, and regulatory factors. Case histories of megaprojects show that continuous challenges to a project’s environmental permits (even after permits have been granted) and labor agreements (even after agreements are in place) do occur. Challenges can arise from entities that at first might appear to be marginal stakeholders or even organizations with no direct stake in the project’s outcome. This is because a megaproject draws attention to itself through its very existence. Megaprojects attract the attention of organizations and individuals that oppose and challenge aspects of the project even though their stake in the project or in the locality or within the country might be viewed as indirect or virtually nonexistent. The project team should cast a wide net in monitoring and maintaining an awareness of potential external stakeholders.  • Project management systems. Megaprojects can strain project control and management systems. Some of the poor results of megaprojects can be attributed to using new and unproven cost control, document control, or material management systems. Kumang is amongst one of the first to execute the new Petronas management system. Hence, it is imperative for the team to ensure project controls are properly developed and document controls are embedded fully.  • Maintaining strong owner teams.

As with the scheduler, the contract specialist plays a key role during both project definition and execution.

The advantage of the cost per barrel comparison is that it provides a consistent measure across all projects and provides a gauge for the cost effectiveness of a company in developing a field. It also provides a useful reflection on the quality of the asset development system when making critical decisions on asset development and concept type during front-end evaluation.  "

The benchmarks for this model are intentionally not concept-specific and not normalized for complexity.  "
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"Low facilities cost per barrel may be caused by development that takes advantage of  pre-existing processing facilities. On average, subsea developments have lower $/BOE costs. Low drilling costs per barrel with respect to the industry mean are either a result of lower drilling  costs than usually achieved in the region or higher average hydrocarbon recovery per well. PLATFORM COST Our Platform Model normalizes for functional complexity, accounting for such factors as  throughput, separation streams, corrosive fluids, pumping power, water treatment, type of drill  rig, and necessary auxiliary features such as power generation, helideck, and living quarters. The model also adjusts for location, water depth, and design wave height. This model  intentionally does not normalize for anticipated life-of-project production streams. PIPELINES COST Industry benchmark costs for pipelines are normalized to a scope (length, size, water  depth, and region) similar to the project. Right-of-way costs and associated environmental and  permitting fees are included. Riser costs are excluded from both project costs and from the  model. The model does not explicitly correct for trenching and exotic materials. The model  simply compares the pipelines to others performing similar duties in the region. Other pipelines  may either have to be trenched or made heavier to ensure stability. The choice of exotic materials is made on economic grounds to avoid high corrosion  allowances. Our model is based on projects that did not require exotic pipeline materials, so we  make a manual adjustment to benchmarks for projects for which exotic materials are essential.

The objective of FEL is to gain a detailed understanding of the project to minimize the number of changes during later phases of project execution.

FEL as a concept includes reservoir evaluation, and project and well definition and design.  "
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"IPA has developed FEL Indices to consistently measure the level of definition achieved  during FEL. For upstream projects, IPA has developed three discipline FEL Indices, for (1) Reservoir, (2) Facilities and (3) Well Construction. All FEL Indices have a scale from 3.00 to 12.00, with 3.00 representing the most advanced level of definition and 12.00 representing just  a sketchy outline of project intent with no formal definition work done. (For illustrative purposes,  the scale is often truncated at 9.00 in IPA reports and presentations.)"
2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"To achieve the extreme FEL rating of 3.00, a team would have to ensure that all FEL components are completed to a Definitive level, including reservoir appraisal, well and facility engineering, and regulatory requirements, which requires that all permits are in hand. However, at the time of authorization, such goals are neither realistic nor necessary. Consequently, for each FEL Index, IPA has identified the range of Best Practical values at authorization. For example, engineering would be only 10 to 30 percent completed—with good participation and buy-in of all team members—and the team would have identified all environmental issues and applied for the required permits, but not necessarily received the permits. Therefore, the goal of all project teams at the time of authorization should be to achieve a Best Practical FEL status, rather than 3.0.  "

2014 Kumang Cluster Ph 1 PRO (Final).pdf,"Each of the Value Improving Practices (VIPs) is defined below. However, these definitions do not explain the requirements for successful VIPs application. Successful VIPs application requires a formal, disciplined, and documented approach with measurable results: • The VIP activities must be scheduled and resourced early during a project's life cycle for these practices to have their maximum effect on project costs. Moreover, resources must be set aside so that the practices may be satisfactorily implemented, perhaps even using individuals external to the project to oversee the application. • The VIP activities must be done thoroughly. For example, ensuring that a project employs the best available technology—the goal of the Technology Selection VIP—requires identification of potential candidates through rigorous patent searches, visits to university research centers and process licensors, and the subsequent evaluation of these candidates. Thorough application of this VIP means that the potential candidates cannot be limited to only those of whom the firm is currently aware. • The VIP must be applied to the full scope of the project (at least initially). Arbitrarily limiting the scope to a portion of the project unnecessarily limits the practices' potential effects. • Guidelines must exist to ensure that each VIP is applied consistently, i.e. which costs should be evaluated (e.g., total life cycle cost) and which economic and financial assumptions should be used. • The results of VIPs application must be documented. Documentation is performed to provide a basis for the project team to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the practice and to provide lessons learned for future project teams. At a minimum, the following information should be recorded: a description of the activity, the monetary value of the scope work reviewed, the monetary savings achieved, and the cost of applying each VIP.

The SOGT Project was an investment by PETRONAS Carigali Sdn BHd (PETRONAS)  intended to design, build, and operate facilities that can receive, process, store, and export oil  and gas production from two offshore fields—oil from Gumusut/Kakap and Malikai (Southern Hub) and gas from Kinabalu and Kebabangan (Northern Hub) in Sabah, Malaysia. The project  was authorised in August 2010 with a budget of MYR4.27 billion4 and target start-up date of March 2013 for Phase 1 and March 2014 for Phase 2. It was rebaselined upon award of the  alliance contractor for overall mechanical completion on 28 December 2013."

The project’s status before authorisation was summarized in the earlier IPA  prospective evaluation.5 Below, we highlight some key milestones and events to provide a  context for the project benchmarks and subsequent conclusions and recommendations. Project Definition The project began in September 2006 when the Petroleum Management Unit (PMU)  awarded the Concept Study and Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) contract to RNZ Integrated (RNZ) Sdn Bhd for an integrated 1,250 MMscfd gas and 300,000 bpd crude  processing facility.

Consequently, the need to address the items from the FEED reviews delayed the bidding start. In response to the FEED reviews, PETRONAS engaged GTS6 in "

Around that time, the business requested the team to devise options for early oil; as a result, a contracting strategy that involved direct management of an engineering contractor by the project team and of a separate procurement, construction, and commissioning (PCC) contractor was investigated due to the business expectation that such a contracting approach would reduce the execution schedule for oil delivery by 4.5 months. As a result, the project team developed two separate ITB packages (EPCC and E&PCC).  "

Authorisation On 29 April 2010, the SOGT Alliance EPCC ITB packages on a lump sum turnkey  (LSTK) basis were issued to nine bidders in a closed competitive bidding process. The  deadline for bids was 29 June 2010, and the EPCC Alliance contract award was planned for September 2010. The contract had a target cost with pain/gain sharing conditions. Technical  and commercial evaluations took 1 month and were completed at the end of July 2010  together with approval from the tendering committee. The SOGT Project received strong support from management to complete the review  in a timely fashion and was eventually authorised with a final approved cost for execution of MYR3.8 billion with a planned mechanical completion date of 29 October 2013 for both  phases. The Alliance contract was awarded on 27 August 2010 to a joint venture comprising Samsung and Naim (Samsung-Naim JV).

Recycling FEL to FEL 2 after a major scope change late in definition may extend cycle time, but can prevent the occurrence of issues in execution as a result of incomplete design. The SOGT Project received updated gas composition data in mid-2008 and also identified items that required recycling the FEED package before issuing the tender. By recycling back to FEL 2 to incorporate the changes and update the FEED package, instead of proceeding with the new information into execution, the SOGT Project achieved Advanced Study engineering definition (which is Best Practical) and reduced the risk of late changes.

Safety management, including training, is paramount for such complex, highly labour-intensive jobs, and the contractor workforce’s experience and its effects on safety need to be subject to a “deep dive” analysis. This was the first time PETRONAS, and its EPCC Alliance contractor carried out work in Sabah, and had limited knowledge of the local workforce capability, which only became a clearer “known unknown” after formation of the AIT.

In addition, a similar exercise determined the best technology for enhanced liquid recovery from the gas stream. In this case, the turbo-expansion option was selected. • Process Simplification was not used. The process was not subject to a function analysis that focused on eliminating chemical or physical processing steps from the project.

Consequently, the Best Practical value at authorisation assumes that only 10 to 30 percent of the engineering has been completed—with good participation and buy-in of all team members—and that the team has identified all environmental issues and applied for the required permits, but has not necessarily received the permits.

Arbitrarily limiting the scope to a portion of the project unnecessarily limits the practices' potential effects. • Guidelines must exist to ensure that each VIP is applied consistently: which costs to evaluate (e.g., total life cycle cost) and which economic and financial assumptions to use. • The results of VIPs’ application must be documented. Documentation is performed to provide a basis for the project team to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the practice and to provide lessons learned for future project teams.

Typically, specialised computer software, a  consultant, or both are necessary. Process Simplification A disciplined analytical method for reducing investment costs—and often operating  costs as well—by either combining or making unnecessary one or more chemical or  physical processing steps. Technology Selection A systematic process by which a company searches for production technology outside  of the company (or, in some instances, in other divisions within the company) that may  be superior to that currently employed in its manufacturing plants. Value Engineering A disciplined method used during design, requiring the use of a trained Value Engineering consultant—usually from outside the project team—aimed at eliminating or  modifying items that do not contribute to meeting business needs. Waste Minimisation A disciplined approach used during design to minimise the production of waste  products. This VIP might result in the addition of equipment or examination of alternate  process technologies that have a lower amount of waste sidestreams.

2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"The Project Control Index (PCI) measures the set of practices by which a project team manages (or plans to manage) cost and schedule performance during the Front-End Loading (FEL) and execution phases of a project. The objective of project control is to establish and maintain a disciplined approach to managing work activities during execution so that planned project outcomes are achieved. As the term implies, project control is a “control” process whereby effective cost and schedule performance baseline plans are established (planning, estimating, and scheduling), measurements of performance against the plan are made and evaluated (progressing and forecasting), and corrective action is taken (change management) when measures indicate a deviation from the plan is occurring or is likely to occur. "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"During FEL, project control focuses on establishing a cost estimate and schedule that are suitable not only as a basis for project decisions, but also as a basis for control of project work activities. A strong control basis supports the achievement of Best Practical FEL. During project execution, project control focuses on measurement and reporting of progress, forecasting, and change management. The PCI quantifies the strength of the planned or actual project control practices. "

2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"One of the primary areas of concern within a company’s project system is the assignment of reliable contingency allowances in project cost estimates. Appropriate levels of contingency that reflect project risks allow better understanding of likely project costs. Ideally, the base estimate (i.e., the estimate without contingency) should include the costs of known items, and the contingency allowance should cover the costs of unknown items. The contingency allowance should then provide a determinable level of confidence that the total cost estimate, including contingency, will not be overrun because of unpredictable, although not extraordinary, events. Contingency is not intended to provide a guarantee that the total cost of a project will not exceed its authorised budget. Instead, contingency represents an allowance of funds to achieve a desired probability that a cost overrun will not occur. "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Setting the contingency too high or too low costs money. If contingency is too high, project teams or management has a strong tendency to consume some or even all of the appropriated money on items outside of the authorised scope. If contingency is set too low, the project will have unrealistic cost control budgets that will tend to drive the team to pursue risky, ineffective, or inefficient execution practices in an attempt to meet the unrealistic target (in other words, the project is more likely to lose control). Also, setting contingency too low tends to erode cost discipline and can lead to time wasted on creative accounting. Finally, with contingency set too low, reductions in scope and/or the rejection of desirable design improvements can result. "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Contingency is closely related to, but distinct from, allowances, such as material take-off allowances or allowances for the event of extreme weather conditions. Contingency is not a reserve or slush fund that the project team cannot spend on the authorised project scope without upper management approval. Likewise, management should not have the expectation that, if a project team does its job well, contingency will not be spent. Both of these views contribute to distortion of the base estimate. When repeated throughout a project system, this distortion makes prediction of total system expenditure difficult.  "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Although often not specifically identified as such, contingency is contained in most project cost estimates. Approaches to assigning contingency are often arbitrary and fail to adjust for the status of project definition at the time of estimate preparation. IPA has developed a systematic method of determining the amount of contingency required for a project based on a parametric statistical model. We formulated this model by collecting detailed histories of projects and identifying key factors that drive differences between project estimates and actual cost outcomes. "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,IPA’S APPROACH TO CONTINGENCY
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"IPA’s statistical model, called the Contingency Allowance Model (CAM), is used to provide an industry benchmark of the contingency level required to achieve various levels of confidence of overrun or underrun. The CAM predicts contingency percentages for each project based on a regression analysis that includes important project drivers and characteristics. The variables included in the model are those that IPA has found to be the strongest drivers of contingency requirements. We detail the model drivers in the following section. "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"The CAM does not attempt to capture all the reasons that actual costs might deviate from estimated costs. Some events and situations that can affect project costs are not, in principle, predictable by estimators. For example, unusually bad weather, labour strikes, shortages of labour and equipment, currency fluctuations, and inflation are risks that can be "

The CAM is used to provide industry benchmarks of contingency required to achieve  various levels of confidence of an overrun or underrun. Each project has unique risk factors  that should be reflected in the estimate contingency, but may not be considered in the CAM. As such, IPA recommends that the project team conduct risk analyses and prepare  contingency estimates that reflect the identified risks. THE COMPONENTS OF THE CAM Equipment Percentage"
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Because major equipment estimates tend to be based on firm quotes, equipment cost is the cost category that experiences the least cost growth. Even for early estimates using historical data or budget quotes, equipment costs tend to be more accurate than estimates for other cost accounts. Therefore, projects that have a high equipment component typically require less contingency.  "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,Project Definition Level
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Project definition (as reflected in the FEL Index) is one of the most important elements in the CAM and has a large influence on the required contingency. However, some elements of definition, such as local labour availability and heat and material balances, also have particular significance. Because FEL is such an important driver of many IPA models, it is discussed in detail in the Front-End Loading Appendix. "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Contracting and Execution Strategy Projects executed using lump-sum contracts typically require less explicit contingency  than other contracting strategies. Lump-sum contracts move much of a project’s risk from the  owner to the contractor, who then compensates by adding contingency to the bid price."
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Execution strategy affects contingency use because, if a project is cost driven, it is less likely to take actions and make changes that will put cost at risk. If a project is schedule driven (i.e., the project team is willing to spend money to achieve its schedule objective), it may employ schedule compression methods, such as overtime and project controls that are difficult to estimate. "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,Company Cost Culture
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Contingency requirements are a function not only of risk drivers and the events that transpire during project execution, but also of the base estimate risk and quality. Projects with conservative (i.e., high confidence) base estimates require less contingency than projects with aggressive, higher risk estimates.  "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"If a company cost culture is punitive (i.e., some adverse effect will occur to the project team members’ careers if project costs overrun), the team will take actions to ensure that an overrun is not likely. The easiest way to do that is to hide contingency or allowances in the                                                 "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"36 The rate of cost escalation (inflation) is an example of a factor that changes project costs, but that estimators cannot predict. Economic modelers are unable to estimate the rate of inflation not only in a narrow segment of the economy, such as the chemical process industries, but also in the overall economy despite the millions of dollars spent each year on these efforts. Lower than expected inflation can bail out a bad estimate, just as unexpectedly high inflation can vitiate a good one. In neither case is the estimator responsible. "

2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"If a company cost culture is one that strives to achieve aggressive, but realistic, targets  and expects that some cost overruns will occur (without punishment), more contingency may  be required because no “fat” is in the estimate to cover uncertainties. Estimate Inclusiveness Estimate inclusiveness is based on a checklist of cost items and elements that are  normally included in total project costs. If an item is excluded from the cost estimate that is  likely to be expended later, cost growth will occur. Process Impurity Problems"
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,IPA rates process impurity problems on a scale that measures the extent to which impurities in process streams were considered problematic during research and design (R&D) and early design. Impurity removal is typically difficult to simulate and therefore carries increased uncertainty. Processes with recycle streams are particularly prone to such difficulties because many are catalyst-dependent processes.  
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,Integrated Project Teams IPA research shows that having an integrated team results in better overall project  performance.

2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Projects involving block steps that are implementing new technology—that is, technology that has no commercial history either within the owner company or elsewhere—have been historically proven to require more contingency. Block steps that include new technology, or new steps as we call them, may involve new chemistry, first-of-a-kind major equipment, or existing equipment performing a new service. New technologies are associated with more risk than both proven technologies and new integrations because Industry has little or no experience with a new technology. As a result, the use of new technology increases the required contingency. "

2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"The Best Practical level of definition for the environmental requirements factor is usually Preliminary. Most projects require environmental and building permits; it is very unusual to have these permits available prior to the start of detailed engineering. Because permit approval tends to be time consuming, most projects would experience an unjustifiable delay if the start of detailed engineering were postponed until permits were issued. All project teams should begin consultations with the relevant environmental agencies so that they can incorporate known requirements into the FEL design. "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,PROJECT EXECUTION PLANNING FACTOR
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Project execution planning encompasses three separate, but related, items. The first item evaluates the composition of the full project team, including the assignment and understanding of roles. The second item addresses the details of the planned contracting strategy for the project. The last item measures the development of a detailed and integrated project schedule that incorporates the effects of equipment delivery dates, interferences, resource loading, and turnover and commissioning sequences for start-up. If all of these items are completed, the factor is rated as Definitive. Usually the schedule is the least complete of the three items. If the schedule includes only major tasks, but identifies the critical path and its components, the factor is rated as Preliminary. If only major milestones are scheduled, usually based on historical factors, the project execution plan is rated as Assumed/Factored. "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"If there is no schedule development, no project team, and no contracting strategy, the project  execution plan is rated as Not Used. ENGINEERING STATUS FACTOR"
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Engineering status in the Project Evaluation System (PES) is characterised by the level of total engineering effort completed at authorisation plus the amount of owner/operator input into the design. Similar to the site-specific definition factors, engineering status is also rated on a scale of 1 to 4. Most projects fall into the Advanced Study or Limited Study categories at authorisation. Typically, 15 to 30 percent of the design is complete for projects rated as an "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,"Advanced Study. Less engineering (about 1 to 5 percent) has been completed for projects categorised as a Limited Study. The other major distinction between these two ratings is whether the plant/owner has had extensive input into the design at the time of estimate preparation. If this input was not available, an increased potential for design changes exists, which leads to cost growth, schedule slip, and operational performance reductions. The "
2014 SOGT CLO (FINAL).pdf,Screening Study rating is assigned to projects for which the process technology is still being selected. The engineering status will be considered Full Design Specification when 40 to 100 percent of the engineering is complete. Rarely is the engineering that extensive—nor should it be—for a project at authorisation.

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"The SOGT Project’s lacks the execution plans required to support its modest cost and schedule targets. A project team that lacks several core owner functions and a defined structure for the alliance execution strategy further accentuates that risk.

Further, the owner team must develop a robust basis for control, reach an agreement with the execution contractor on the control plans, and execute with minimum change.

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,The SOGT Project’s overall cycle time for Phase 1 is 51 percent longer than Industry mainly due to the very long FEL phase. The project’s long development phase was caused by numerous design and scope changes that ultimately led to an aborted bidding process and a project recycle back to FEL 27. The planned execution duration for Phase 1 is comparable to Industry. Execution includes slightly conservative detailed engineering and construction phases as well as a heavy degree of overlap between the phases. This strategy presents a higher risk of engineering rework and/or construction delays if the release of drawings is not properly sequenced with construction. The planned start-up time for Phase 1 is industry average.  
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,OTHER PROJECT ISSUES The SOGT Project is a megaproject so we have also evaluated it in the context of
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"IPA’s research on megaproject success and failure. As a megaproject, the SOGT Project faces several additional risks. IPA research8 found that megaprojects have characteristics that pose challenges to project teams. These challenges manifest themselves in the form of significant cost overruns and schedule slip. A review of megaproject case studies9 shows that many megaprojects fail because they do not start out with a sound implementation basis and, once approved, it is not possible to retrieve a poorly defined project from the path to failure. Reasons for megaproject failure include being schedule-driven, incomplete FEL, a weak and non-integrated owner team, and a lack of understanding local labour laws and labour availability. All of these factors are applicable to the SOGT Project which, like many failed megaprojects, is schedule driven, lacks Best Practical FEL and has a non-integrated project team. The project team will need to implement exceptional discipline and controls to successfully achieve the stated business objectives. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,The proposed LS-EPCC alliance contracting strategy also presents risk to the SOGT
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Project. IPA research10 has shown significant differences in project outcomes depending on the selected contracting strategy. The LS-EPC strategy is associated with higher cost and faster execution time, but with poorer operability performance in comparison with the mixed contract11 approach. In weighing the merits of the contracting strategy, on average, LS-EPC contracts are more predictable and use less contingency than other contract types. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"However, LS-EPC contracts tend to be less effective and more expensive because they seek to transfer project risk from the owner to the contractor. This transfer is based on the assumption that the contractors are leading execution and should be able to manage the execution risks, thereby yielding an efficient result. However, contractors are not able to bear equity risks, and a substantial loss on a project can jeopardise the contracting firm’s earnings or even its survival. Therefore, contractors will almost always bid with a high premium, so the project risk is directly related to the premium of the LS-EPC project. The "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"LS-EPCC alliance contracting strategy for the SOGT Project, undermined by the moderate drivers, makes it vulnerable to high risk premiums and uncompetitive outcomes.

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"At the end of FEED, the SOGT Project has moderate drivers in place to achieve its targets. The project’s overall definition is mainly hindered by the lack of fully detailed execution plans, which could cause problems during execution such as poor control, late changes, poor productivity and execution slip. Specific gaps include the lack of a detailed schedule to support the team’s project control plans.  "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"The SOGT Project team lacks not only core functions but also an organised structure for the alliance execution strategy. Projects with three key team attributes such as an integrated team, high involvement and adequate staff are able to significantly reduce the risk premium payable to the contractors for all contract types.  "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"The project has encountered changes and additions since its start in early 2006, including the recent business decision to pursue an EPCC alliance contract strategy for execution. This proposed contract approach involves heavy reliance on the contractor to handle key project activities (i.e., develop execution plans, manage construction and control, etc.) instead of the owner. However, past PETRONAS projects12 have not had success when using strategies that largely rely on contractor performance for the development of the execution plans.  "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"The SOGT Project’s scope includes elements whose cost effectiveness range from aggressive to conservative. The cost estimate for the gas plant appears to be conservative, the cost estimates of the export pipelines appear to be aggressive and the estimated costs of the crude and condensate storage tanks are comparable to Industry. Finally, the contingency is aggressive relative to industry use. The SOGT Project has set an industry average execution schedule target for Phase 1.  "

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Based on our analysis, we offer the following recommendations to assist the SOGT Project team:"
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"1. Improve the SOGT Project’s execution plans by independently developing a detailed schedule. Before the EPCC contract is awarded, the project team should develop a detailed, resource-loaded schedule for execution based on critical-path methodology. This would enable the team to understand the schedule requirements and assist with the bids evaluation and contractor negotiations. The detailed schedule will also assist with the development of strong control plans which will be critical to the project’s success. "

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"3. Understand that contracting strategies and contractors cannot compensate for key owner-led project practices. Contracting is a second-order driver of project outcomes compared to team development, FEL, VIPs use, and execution discipline. In addition, being actively involved in resource planning (particularly in labour-short environments), leading the interface management, and developing independent schedule and cost estimates takes away risk from the EPCC contractors and helps reduce risk premiums. Relying entirely on the EPCC contractors for construction management and control has not worked well in the past for PETRONAS projects or for projects from other companies. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"4. Review the allocated contingency and the gas plant cost estimate, especially bulk materials and field labour costs. The project’s allocated contingency is very aggressive relative to the industry benchmark. The estimate for the gas plant includes 24 percent more bulk materials than Industry and field labour costs that are more than twice the industry average for the amount of installed bulk materials (the main driver of field costs) the project plans to install. While it is important to avoid aggressive cost targets on megaprojects, the project team should validate the resource requirements and assumed productivity norms. The project’s estimated office costs appear low and are inconsistent with the longer than industry planned engineering duration. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"5. Ensure sufficient detailed engineering is completed before commencing construction and establish stringent QA/QC measures for engineering deliverables. The project’s execution schedule includes significant engineering and construction phases overlap. If detailed engineering slips, so that less engineering is completed when construction starts, late changes and loss of construction productivity are likely. The project team should ensure that engineering quality is not compromised to decrease the likelihood of construction productivity losses; it should delay the start of construction until sufficient detailed engineering progress has been achieved.

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"The SOGT Project will be executed under a lump-sum (LS) EPCC project-specific alliance contract, which the project team plans to award in September 2010 after a competitive bidding process with nine contractors. The original execution strategy required the owner project team to directly manage a LS-EPCC contractor. However in April 2010 the business decided to pursue an EPCC alliance approach for the process facilities. This project-specific alliance strategy is driven by the business’s wish to avoid poor project outcomes recently experienced with large projects that were executed using PETRONAS' typical owner-managed EPCC contract. The business recognised that lack of experience in managing EPCC contractors has, in the past, contributed to poor outcomes. The alliance concept is an attempt to offset the lack of such experience by imbedding PETRONAS personnel in the organisation structure to develop an integrated owner-contractor alliance project team.  "

Non-process buildings will be executed under a PCC contract directly managed by the alliance. "

The ALT will include four PETRONAS personnel (including the chairperson) and three EPCC contractor personnel. The alliance organisation structure has not been developed but PETRONAS plans to appoint around 20 personnel. In addition, the business has proposed to undertake a series of team alignment and conditioning sessions in the early months of the alliance to help the team mature into an integrated and robust team. This evaluation will show that the presence and size of robust owner teams in alliances are critical requirements for successful project outcomes and in particular for megaproject outcomes. "

The overall plot plans are detailed and include all major equipment locations, infrastructure, offices, and associated facilities. The plot was reviewed to accommodate flare clearance and blast/heat flux range requirements. Changes to the locations of the administration buildings were finalised during reviews in February and March 2010; the reviews made no changes to the process facilities layouts. After a Constructability Review, the plot was approved for the bidding process. Final plot plan design rests with the EPCC alliance contractor, so further optimisation is expected but no major changes. • Soils and Hydrology Data are Definitive. Extensive additional geotechnical investigation was done in April 2009, with 97 boreholes and 102 cone penetration tests (CPTs) drilled at the planned locations of all major equipment and storage facilities.

Numerous IPA research studies have shown that PEP is a significant driver of project performance. For projects with an incentivised LS contracting strategy, which is essentially the case for the SOGT Project, PEP is a far more significant driver of schedule acceleration than incentives21 as shown in Figure 3.

In addition, a similar exercise was done to determine the best technology for enhanced liquid recovery from the gas stream. In this case, the turbo-expansion option was selected. • Process Simplification was not used.

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,IPA research has identified several practices that promote safety performance. A project’s definition is the primary driver of safety performance. A project’s safety performance (DART rate and recordable incident rate) correlates directly with FEL: better project definition leads to better safety performance. Another driver of safety performance is the use of Constructability Reviews. Projects that do not complete Constructability Reviews before FID have DART rates double those of projects that complete Constructability 
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Reviews. Other drivers of safety performance include establishing safety programs during FEL, early involvement of the contractors and subcontractors, pre-task planning, and safety  rewards given directly to workers.

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"IPA research26 has found that megaprojects have many characteristics that pose challenges to project teams. These challenges manifest themselves in the form of significant cost overruns and schedule slip.

The average performance of megaproject successes and failures are shown in Table 10. Nearly half the projects were deemed failures because of their performance against these criteria. The remaining projects were deemed successful projects.

Well defined megaprojects should set industry average cost and schedule targets. Setting aggressive targets introduces unnecessary risk to the inherent brittleness of megaprojects.

The owner core team consists of those individuals assigned to the project during FEL as their primary job activity. Large owner FEL teams correlate strongly with large owner execution teams. Team size, team integration and continuity, and the composition of team members are the characteristics of owner teams that are key drivers of megaproject excellence. Team size improves FEL and improves the chances of a team being integrated. Successful megaprojects average 20 people28 on the core team while failed megaprojects average 13 people on the core team. Joint venture (JV) representatives have an important role to play and can be considered key members of the core team. JV involvement is needed throughout the life of the project. The key team members of most importance were found to be the owner scheduler, owner contracts specialist, and the owner construction manager. We say this because when all of these three owner positions were filled, every megaproject in the study succeeded. And when all three positions were not filled, every megaproject failed. Strong, sizeable owner teams actively managing the project are almost always necessary to project success. The SOGT Project team does not yet include the three key functions mentioned above and uncertainty remains about the number of owner project team members in the proposed alliance.

For a project the size of the SOGT Project, IPA considers these services as available on the world open  market (WOM); therefore, they should not be subjected to regional corrections  for benchmarking purposes.   • Equipment and bulk materials were mainly purchased in Europe, Asia, and Australia (i.e., WOM). Therefore, we did not adjust these costs.   • Construction labour costs were adjusted using an average rate of R50 (US$15.1)  per hour in Sabah compared with US$67 in the USGC. Construction productivity CONFIDENTIAL 40 IPA   was adjusted with a 1.7 factor, or about 70 percent worse than the USGC.

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"At the end of FEED, the SOGT Project has moderate drivers in place to achieve its targets. The project’s overall definition is mainly hindered by the lack of fully detailed execution plans, which could cause problems during execution such as poor control, late changes, poor productivity and execution slip. Specific gaps include the lack of a detailed schedule to support the team’s project control plans.  "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"The SOGT Project team lacks not only core functions but also an organised structure for the alliance execution strategy. Projects with three key team attributes such as an integrated team, high involvement and adequate staff are able to significantly reduce the risk premium payable to the contractors for all contract types.  "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"The project has encountered changes and additions since its start in early 2006, including the recent business decision to pursue an EPCC alliance contract strategy for execution. This proposed contract approach involves heavy reliance on the contractor to handle key project activities (i.e., develop execution plans, manage construction and control, etc.) instead of the owner. However, past PETRONAS projects43 have not had success when using strategies that largely rely on contractor performance for the development of the execution plans.  "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"The SOGT Project’s scope includes elements whose cost effectiveness range from aggressive to conservative. The cost estimate for the gas plant appears to be conservative, the cost estimates of the export pipelines appear to be aggressive and the estimated costs of the crude and condensate storage tanks are comparable to Industry. Finally, the contingency is aggressive relative to industry use. The SOGT Project has set an industry average execution schedule target for Phase 1.  "

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"RECOMMENDATIONS Based on our analysis, we offer the following recommendations to assist the SOGT Project team:"
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"1. Improve the SOGT Project’s execution plans by independently developing a detailed schedule. Before the EPCC contract is awarded, the project team should develop a detailed, resource-loaded schedule for execution based on critical-path methodology. This would enable the team to understand the schedule requirements and assist with the bids evaluation and contractor negotiations. The                                                 "

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"2. Develop an integrated and robust project team to lead the alliance organisation, and maintain continuity. Team integration, strong owner involvement, and adequate team size are key factors associated with successful megaprojects and reduced risk premiums in lump sum EPC contracts. The business must ensure that critical team functions in the proposed alliance (i.e., project management, construction management, and cost and schedule controls) are staffed by "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,PETRONAS team members and that the owner’s presence in the alliance at  least 25 people.
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"3. Understand that contracting strategies and contractors cannot compensate for key owner-led project practices. Contracting is a second-order driver of project outcomes compared to team development, FEL, VIPs use, and execution discipline. In addition, being actively involved in resource planning (particularly in labour-short environments), leading the interface management, and developing independent schedule and cost estimates takes away risk from the EPCC contractors and helps reduce risk premiums. Relying entirely on the EPCC contractors for construction management and control has not worked well in the past for PETRONAS projects or for projects from other companies. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"4. Review the allocated contingency and the gas plant cost estimate, especially bulk materials and field labour costs. The project’s allocated contingency is very aggressive relative to the industry benchmark. The estimate for the gas plant includes 24 percent more bulk materials than Industry and field labour costs that are more than twice the industry average for the amount of installed bulk materials (the main driver of field costs) the project plans to install. While it is important to avoid aggressive cost targets on megaprojects, the project team should validate the resource requirements and assumed productivity norms. The project’s estimated office costs appear low and are inconsistent with the longer than industry planned engineering duration. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"5. Ensure sufficient detailed engineering is completed before commencing construction and establish stringent QA/QC measures for engineering deliverables. The project’s execution schedule includes significant engineering and construction phases overlap. If detailed engineering slips, so that less engineering is completed when construction starts, late changes and loss of construction productivity are likely. The project team should ensure that engineering quality is not compromised to decrease the likelihood of construction productivity losses; it should delay the start of construction until sufficient detailed engineering progress has been achieved.

The objective of project control is to establish and maintain a disciplined approach to managing work activities during execution so that planned project outcomes are achieved. As the term implies, project control is a “control” process whereby effective cost and schedule performance baseline plans are established (planning, estimating, and scheduling), measurements of performance against the plan are made and evaluated (progressing and forecasting), and corrective action is taken (change management) when measures indicate a deviation from the plan is occurring or is likely to occur.

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,CONFIDENTIAL XV IPA CONTINGENCY ALLOWANCE MODEL APPENDIX WHAT IS CONTINGENCY? One of the primary areas of concern within a company’s project system is the  assignment of reliable contingency allowances in project cost estimates. Appropriate  contingency that reflect project risks allow better understanding of likely project costs.
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Ideally, the base estimate (i.e., the estimate without contingency) should include the costs of known items, and the contingency allowance should cover the costs of unknown items. The contingency allowance should then provide a determinable level of confidence that the total cost estimate, including contingency, will not be overrun because of unpredictable, although not extraordinary, events. Contingency is not intended to provide a guarantee that the total cost of a project will not exceed its authorised budget. Instead, contingency represents an allowance of funds to achieve a desired probability that a cost overrun will not occur. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Setting the contingency too high or too low costs money. If contingency is too high, project teams or management has a strong tendency to consume some or even all of the appropriated money on items outside of the authorised scope. If contingency is set too low, the project will have unrealistic cost control budgets that will tend to drive the team to pursue risky, ineffective, or inefficient execution practices in an attempt to meet the unrealistic target (in other words, the project is more likely to lose control). Also, setting contingency too low tends to erode cost discipline and can lead to time wasted on creative accounting. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Finally, with contingency set too low, reductions in scope and/or the rejection of desirable  design improvements can result."
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Contingency is closely related to, but distinct from, allowances, such as material takeoff allowances or allowances for the event of extreme weather conditions. Contingency is not a reserve or slush fund that the project team cannot spend on the authorised project scope without upper management approval. Likewise, management should not have the expectation that, if a project team does its job well, contingency will not be spent. Both of these views contribute to distortion of the base estimate. When repeated throughout a project system, this distortion makes prediction of total system expenditure difficult.  "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Although often not specifically identified as such, contingency is contained in most project cost estimates. Approaches to assigning contingency are often arbitrary and fail to adjust for the status of project definition at the time of estimate preparation. IPA has developed a systematic method of determining the amount of contingency required for a project based on a parametric statistical model. We formulated this model by collecting detailed histories of projects and identifying key factors that drive differences between project estimates and actual cost outcomes. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,IPA’S APPROACH TO CONTINGENCY
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"IPA’s statistical model, called the Contingency Allowance Model (CAM), is used to provide an industry benchmark of the contingency required to achieve various levels of confidence of overrun or underrun. The CAM predicts contingency percentages for each project based on a regression analysis that includes important project drivers and characteristics. The variables included in the model are those that IPA has found to be the strongest drivers of contingency requirements. We detail the model drivers in the following section. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"The CAM does not attempt to capture all the reasons that actual costs might deviate  from estimated costs. Some events and situations that can affect project costs are not, in  principle, predictable by estimators. For example, unusually bad weather, labour strikes, CONFIDENTIAL XVI IPA   shortages of labour and equipment, currency fluctuations, and inflation are risks that can be  assessed in only a rudimentary way by estimators.45 Therefore, IPA systematically removes  these external factors from our analysis of capital cost estimation."
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Again, the CAM is used to provide industry benchmarks of contingency required to achieve various levels of confidence of an overrun or underrun. Each project has unique risk factors that should be reflected in the contingency estimate, but may not be considered in the CAM. As such, IPA recommends that the project team conduct risk analyses and prepare contingency estimates that reflect the identified risks.  "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,THE COMPONENTS OF THE CAM Equipment Percentage
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Because major equipment estimates tend to be based on firm quotes, equipment cost is the cost category that experiences the least cost growth. Even for early estimates using historical data or budget quotes, equipment costs tend to be more accurate than estimates for other cost accounts. Therefore, projects that have a high equipment component typically require less contingency.  "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,Project Definition
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Project definition is one of the most important elements in the CAM and has a large influence on the required contingency. The primary factor in the CAM is definition as reflected in IPA’s Front-End Loading (FEL) Index. However, some elements of definition, such as the definition of local labour availability and heat and material balances, also have particular significance. Because FEL is such an important driver of many IPA models, it is discussed in detail in the Front-End Loading Appendix. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,Contracting and Execution Strategy
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Projects executed using lump-sum contracts typically require less explicit contingency than other contracting strategies. Lump-sum contracts move much of a project’s risk from the owner to the contractor, which then compensates by adding contingency to the bid price. Execution strategy affects contingency use because, if a project is cost driven, it is less likely to take actions and make changes that will put cost at risk. If a project is schedule driven (i.e., the project team is willing to spend money to achieve its schedule objective), it may employ schedule compression methods, such as overtime and project controls that are difficult to estimate. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Company Cost Culture Contingency requirements are a function not only of risk drivers and the events that  transpire during project execution, but of the quality and risk level of the base estimate. Projects with conservative (i.e., high confidence) base estimates will require less  contingency than projects with aggressive, higher risk estimates."
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"45 The rate of cost escalation (inflation) is an example of a factor that changes project costs, but that estimators cannot predict. Economic modelers are unable to estimate the rate of inflation not only in a narrow segment of the economy, such as the chemical process industries, but also in the overall economy despite the millions of dollars spent each year on these efforts. Lower than expected inflation can bail out a bad estimate, just as unexpectedly high inflation can vitiate a good one. In neither case is the estimator responsible. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,CONFIDENTIAL XVII IPA
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"If a company cost culture is punitive (i.e., some adverse effect will occur to the project team members’ careers if project costs overrun), the team will take actions to ensure that an overrun is not likely. The easiest way to do that is to hide contingency or allowances in the base estimate because management is historically not receptive to substantial explicit contingency. As a result, although the total contingency consumed is at least as great as in a more forgiving culture, less explicit contingency is required. Typical evidence of this type of culture is that the company rarely overruns any project budgets, and many projects underrun their base estimate.  "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"If a company cost culture is one that strives to achieve aggressive, but realistic,  targets and expects that some cost overruns will occur (without punishment), more  contingency may be required because no “fat” is in the estimate to cover uncertainties. Application of this variable requires that, to the best of its abilities, the project team  and IPA analyst make an objective assessment of the company culture and its effect on the  base estimate. Estimate Inclusiveness Estimate inclusiveness is based on a checklist of cost items and elements that are  normally included in total project costs. If an item is excluded from the cost estimate that is  likely to be expended later, cost growth will occur. Process Impurity Problems"
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,IPA rates process impurity problems on a scale that measures the extent to which impurities in process streams were considered problematic during research and design (R&D) and early design. Impurity removal is typically difficult to simulate and therefore carries increased uncertainty.

This scale helps predict cost growth because resolving problems associated with impurities often requires expensive changes in the equipment design. "

Other measures of project size, such as process complexity and capacity, have also been correlated with engineering and construction time. However, a factor relative to the estimated cost is a better indicator of the amount of work to be performed than engineering and construction time, which becomes statistically insignificant after the estimated cost is considered.

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Typically, as the duration of the engineering-construction overlap increases, the number of delays and inefficiencies in construction also increase. Often, this overlap means that the construction phase will be delayed while the team waits for drawings or that the construction schedule will be determined based on when the drawings will become available. These methods may, or may not, result in the most efficient construction order. "

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Project execution planning is the key parameter in project definition that relates to construction schedule outcomes. This factor is measured at authorisation time. Project execution planning relates to three areas: (1) the composition of the project team, including the assignment and understanding of roles; (2) the selected contracting strategy and planning thereof; and (3) the development of a detailed and integrated project schedule that incorporates the planned equipment delivery dates and the size restrictions of the site, is resource-loaded, and includes turnover and commissioning sequences. This parameter is rated on a scale that ranges from 1 to 4, or from Definitive to Not Used, respectively.  "

Projects executed using lump-sum engineering and construction contracts are  typically faster than industry average.

2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"Projects in the IPA database have estimates, and if applicable, actual cost data, in local currency money of the day. To compare any project with other similar projects in IPA’s databases, we have to adjust all the costs to constant year United States (U.S.) dollars. The baseline year we currently use is 2003. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"For actual costs, normalisation is done in the following steps: For each expenditure category, we apply a standard S-curve expenditure distribution to get expenditures for each month. Those monthly expenditures are converted from local currency to U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate of the month. We then de-escalate the U.S. dollar amounts to the year 2003 on a cost category basis using escalation data. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"For estimates, the normalisation is similar. We remove any escalation included in the estimate. We convert from local currency to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the estimate. Finally, we de-escalate the U.S. dollar amounts to the year 2003 on a cost category basis using publicly available escalation data. "
2014 SOGT PRO (Final).pdf,"All IPA models, benchmarks, and statistical analyses are performed using constant 2003 U.S. dollars. From any result, in constant 2003 U.S. dollars, we generate an index  being the ratio of project cost to the database benchmark: Index = Project Cost ( 2003US$)    Benchmark (20003US$) In our reports and presentations, however, we present our results in terms that are   comparable to the local currency money of the day, either as spent or as estimated. To generate the benchmarks in local currency money of the day, we divide the  project figures by the relevant index: Benchmark (local currency money of the day) =      = Project Cost (Local currency money of the day)    Index (2003US$)      = Project Cost (Local currency money of the day) X Benchmark (2003US$)   Project Cost (2003US$) Because the above procedure effectively re-escalates and converts back to local   currency, project teams can recognise the estimates and costs presented in our reports and  presentations, and also make direct comparisons with the benchmarks in local currency  money of the day. We recognise that, with this methodology, short-term currency fluctuations can have  a minor influence on benchmarks for projects that account in currencies other than the U.S.  dollar."

2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"This IPA report summarises the performance of PETRONAS’ KNAG Project. This closeout evaluation of the KNAG Project compares the project’s actual performance with the performance planned at authorisation. A comparison is also made with similar completed projects in Industry and with PETRONAS’ recent average performance. Based on this analysis, past IPA research, and project team input, we also provide lessons learned that can be used to improve future project performance. It should be noted that this closeout evaluation was conducted when KNAG Project had not yet brought KN West Ultra Deep (UD) into production, and the KN West Deep production data was not available. As such, we did not evaluate the production attainment, reservoir production estimate (RPE), or wells outcomes associated with the KNAG Project’s West reservoir, all of which are crucial measures of project performance. When this information becomes available, IPA will finalise the analysis in a second closeout evaluation. Due to the limited granularity in cost data, IPA was unable to provide cost deviation metrics for the KNAG Project. "

2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"PROJECT BACKGROUND The fields in the Kinabalu (KN) area were discovered in 1989 by Sabah Shell Petroleum Company (SSPC). The KNAG field is located in Sub-Block 6S-23 in SB-1 PSC, 55  km northwest of Labuan offshore Sabah at a depth of 54 m. The Kinabalu NAG (KNAG)  consists of East, West, West Ultra Deep (UD), and West Ultra-Ultra Deep (UUD)10 reservoirs. The KN West reservoirs straddle the Malaysia-Brunei border. SSPC has been producing oil from the shallow reservoirs in the KN Main field since 1997 with a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) that was set to expire in 2011. Further  exploration by SSPC into the deeper stratigraphic zones proved the existence of gas and  condensate on both sides of the KN fault, namely the KN East and KN West11 reservoirs. SSPC prepared a field development plan (FDP) for the non-associated gas (NAG) in KN West  and KN East in May 2003, but the NAG from these deeper accumulations was relinquished to PETRONAS. PETRONAS subsequently awarded the block to PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd  (PCSB) in 2007. Pursuant to the above, a project team was formed in September 2006 and KNAG field development commenced shortly after. Due to the limited basic data that were available, the KNAG Project experienced  prolonged delays from September 2006 to mid-2007. As a result, the KNAG Project team and MPM agreed to address the issue by splitting the FDP and execution into two stages:    Stage 1: Developing the FDP using all available data with a submission to MPM in 2008     Stage 2: Developing an addendum to the Stage 1 FDP to incorporate KN-Y  appraisal result with submission in 2009 The FDP submitted for sanction did not include detailed West and West UD reservoir  definition. MPM requested the project team to submit an addendum for the deeper West  reservoirs, which at the time, had not been fully appraised."

KNJT-C The KNJT-C substructure is a steel template-type tripod structure that was designed  for a water depth of 53 m Mean Seal Level (MSL). The jacket accommodates risers, caissons,  a pedestal crane, and boat landing. The KNJT-C topside structure consists of multiple integrated decks: main, cellar,  mezzanine, and close drain. The topside consists of well production facilities such as  wellheads, well flowlines, a production header, flowline metering, and a pig launcher.

The project team attributed the lower cost to the increased pipeline lay productivity, despite  the significantly higher pipeline layrates (see Figure 4). In addition to the export pipeline, the KNAG Project’s East wells were drilled and completed at a lower cost than anticipated. The  lower cost can be attributed to the lower than anticipated rig rate and installation of a less  complex well design. 24 As reported at IPA’s annual Upstream Industry Benchmarking Consortium (UIBC) meeting in November 2013.

2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"Projects throughout the process industries—oil and gas, chemicals, minerals—have been getting significantly larger and more complex over the past decade or so. The underlying reasons for increasing project size and difficulty are understood: We are developing natural resources in progressively more difficult circumstances simply because we have to. Moreover, the choice of oil and gas developments is influenced by the decisions of some large resource-holding countries to restrict or delay the development of some more easily accessible reservoirs.    "
2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"Original IPA research on large industrial projects noted that success, measured by how well a project met promises made at the time of the financial investment decision, declines rapidly with project size. While projects in the $300 million to $600 million range were largely successful, the success rate for the megaprojects—defined as over $1 billion—was about 50 percent. Interestingly, megaprojects in other industrial sectors, such as downstream, minerals, and chemicals, had about the same rates of success and failure. "
2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"In an updated study49, with a much larger sample of both oil and gas and other process industry megaprojects, the conclusion is quite different for oil and gas projects. While non-oil and gas development projects increased in size and difficulty, they maintained a success rate of about 50 percent.  The rate of success is certainly not good, but at least it had not declined despite the much more difficult projects market. Meanwhile, performance in oil and gas development megaprojects collapsed; only 22 percent of the projects could reasonably be called successful.   "

2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"The 2011 Megaprojects Study was based on data gathered from over 300 recent megaprojects.  The average project in the database is about $3 billion. The largest project, a large field development, was $18 billion. The median authorization date was 2003. About 40 percent of the projects in the megaprojects database are oil and gas production projects; the other 60 percent comprise petroleum processing, minerals, chemicals, LNG, power, and pipelines.  The oil and gas projects were executed by 33 companies acting as lead operator. "

OUTCOMES OF OIL AND GAS MEGAPROJECTS Table 15 provides some evidence that upstream megaprojects are not faring as well  as other industrial megaprojects.

CONFIDENTIAL V IPA   frequently quite disappointing in terms of production. The failure to produce is by far the most  economically damaging result. Looking just at the small group of successful E&P projects, a much clearer picture  emerges of the size of the economic disaster represented in the overall results.

The successes were as challenging technologically as the failures—there is no systematic difference in water depth, metocean conditions, or technical complexity. The successes were, on average, more innovative than the failures, although the difference is not statistically significant.   "
2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"By contrast, the failures were really dismal projects: badly overrun, very expensive, very late in delivery, and two-thirds are production failures. Note in Figure 1 that even though the failures slipped by 30 percent, their required execution time was just a few percent longer than the successes. Conversely, the successes were extraordinarily successful in every outcome dimension except schedule, in which they were merely average. That anomaly in the pattern begins to shed light on what separates successful and unsuccessful upstream megaprojects: whether or not the projects set aggressive schedules.  "
2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"UNDERSTANDING THE POORER OUTCOMES Three major factors, taken together, explain the poorer outcomes of upstream  megaprojects. All three are manifestations of the industry’s struggle to effectively integrate the  functions that are needed to produce excellent upstream projects. The three factors are:"
2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"1. Weaker Front-End Loading. Oil and gas megaproject outcomes are particularly sensitive to the completeness of the front-end work. As FEL degrades, megaproject cost overruns mount quickly.  The average oil and gas megaproject was defined to a level right in the middle of the Fair range of IPA’s FEL Index scale.  "
2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"CONFIDENTIAL VI IPA The typical non-upstream megaproject was defined in the upper half of the Good   range. Given the added sensitivity of oil and gas projects to the quality of FEL, that  difference translates into a great deal more cost growth for oil and gas projects."
2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"2. Turnover of the Project Director. Continuity of the project leadership is almost essential to project success and much more important for oil and gas than other industrial sectors’ projects. For smaller projects, turnover in the project manager position usually drives a delay in execution and a modest amount of cost growth, as minor changes to project scope are made by the functions that were not getting all they wanted from the prior project manager. For megaprojects, the turnover of the project director is associated with substantially poorer projects. The turnover of the project director for an average upstream megaproject is associated with a 30 percent decline in the probability of achieving a successful project even after first controlling for the effects of Front-End Loading.  Turnover of the project director is quite devastating for oil and gas megaprojects even if a good job has been done in project development and preparation. "
2015 KNAG CLO (Final).pdf,"3. Schedule Pressure. The strong tendency of upstream businesses to establish aggressive schedules accentuates the effects of the two factors above.  The most important difference between upstream and other industrial megaprojects is found in schedule strategy. Outside E&P, the strategy is usually to set the project’s duration at or close to the average speed. In contrast, 54 percent of upstream projects were explicitly “schedule-driven.” In addition, upstream megaprojects average a Schedule Aggressiveness Index of 0.90. In other words, oil and gas projects are routinely establishing schedule targets for execution that cannot be met.  When a project attempts to achieve unobtainable speed, the quality of all work that goes into successful projects begins to erode. Given the way that large companies organize large developments, the financial analysts who are pushing the businesses to drive for speed are actually doing the industry a massive disservice.    "

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Development Project is not competitive compared to Industry. For similar recoverable volumes, the cost to develop this field is almost twice as expensive as other upstream developments. The platform (KNPG-B) is slightly more expensive than the industry average compared with projects executed globally. However, the KNJT-C platform is more expensive than other projects executed globally. The higher than industry average cost for the facilities scope can be partially attributed to the lack of a detailed cost estimate which included embedded escalation and some shared costs the team could not allocate. Furthermore the stringent PETRONAS Technical Standard (PTS), which is required to be used for all facilities design, is in need of an update, as mentioned by the Facilities team. The export pipeline is significantly more expensive in both regional and global benchmark. The export pipeline was benchmarked based on the original 28-inch, 150-km dimensions. The approved pipeline cost is about 50 percent higher than the awarded contract cost because the pipeline cost estimate was not updated after the design dimensions were changed prior to project authorisation (the original diameter for the export pipeline was 28 inches, but the current design calls for 24-inch pipe).

The approved cost for the KN East wells is significantly more expensive than Industry for a well with a similar complexity. As with the pipeline costs, the anticipated final estimate for the KN East wells campaign is about 30 percent lower than the approved cost at sanction.

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,The KNAG Development Project evaluation was conducted post-authorisation. The objective for this late evaluation was to assess the level of project definition at authorisation as an academic exercise and to assist the project team during execution. The drivers are related to the potential project outcomes through the Pathway to Success shown in Figure 1.  
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Given the lack of basic data from the aggressive appraisal campaigns in the KNAG  fields, the KNAG Development Project was unable to define the subsurface scope effectively  and therefore could not obtain FDP approval from the Petroleum Management Unit (PMU). Having said this, the PMU Milestone Reviews (MR) #2 and #3 (Static and Dynamic reviews,  respectively) should have prepared the team for the final review of the FDP at MR #4. Therefore, in part, the team was not given enough guidance in developing the FDP that  would shape the entire scope of the KNAG development. To date, the FDP has not been  approved by the PMU. The project team is finalising the FDP Addendum, which includes the CONFIDENTIAL  IPA xii  appraisal well drilled in late 2009 and has updated information on the high pressure, high  temperature (HPHT) reservoirs. Hence, the Reservoir FEL was not Best Practical at  authorisation."
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Inadequate HPHT reservoir definition puts a project at high risk of not meeting its objectives because reservoir understanding is the basis that feeds into the wells and facilities design. Thus, it is not surprising that Facilities FEL (predominately the HPHT scope) was not adequately defined at authorisation and that Wells FEL (for the KN West scope) is constrained by a lack of basic reservoir data.  "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"The KNAG Development Project is considered a megaproject with a number of technical difficulties in both the facilities and wells scopes, particularly related to the design for the HPHT environment. The project team, and PCSB as a whole, has no experience in developing HPHT reservoirs. The lack of integration with other stakeholders e.g., the PMU, operations, line departments, and capability department is a major concern and given the complexities and schedule constraints of this project, the success of the project will depend on improving the communication flow among the respective stakeholders. This also places more importance on maintaining the well construction team (and growing the team with experienced HPHT staff) and ensuring that communication is maintained with drilling, operations, and subsurface personnel throughout execution.

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,The production platform’s cost is slightly more expensive than the industry average.
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"However, given that the first gas date has shifted from 2011 to 2013, the facilities’ cost may increase (more significantly in a lump-sum environment due to change orders) beyond the authorised budget, which will hurt the project’s cost competitiveness. The tripod platform is more expensive than other similar platforms executed globally. The offshore pipeline cost estimate was set based on old design dimensions and was never updated until the contract was awarded post-authorisation. The higher than industry average facilities scope can be partially attributed to the lack of detail in the cost estimate which likely has significant embedded escalation. The KN East well campaign cost was set conservatively. In fact, given the current estimate (post authorisation), the wells campaign cost is closer to the industry average for similar well designs. With an already high development cost, a possible downgrade in recoverable resources may be detrimental to the project economics.  "

However, because this date was moved to 2013, the execution schedule is considerably longer than industry average. Critical to the schedule is the offshore installation and SIMOPS with drilling.

The KNAG Development Project is highly dependent on a number of these Sabah and Sarawak projects. The success of the KNAG Development Project is dependent on proactively managing the scheduling interdependencies. The project has already been affected by the bundled contracting strategy with other similar megaprojects and the SOGT first gas date changes. The first gas delay will have significant re-percussion if the team does not monitor and understand the consequences of such delays, in particularly the fabrication yard utilisation and installation vessel schedule which may clash with other projects using the same yard and resources.

XXI CONFIDENTIAL  IPA 1 BACKGROUND HISTORY AND OBJECTIVES This report presents our evaluation of the Kinabalu NAG (KNAG) Development Project’s level of definition as well as an evaluation of the cost, schedule, and performance  risks associated with the development. The business objective for the KNAG Development Project field is to provide 300 million standard cubic per day (MMscfd) of gas to commission  the Sabah Oil Gas Terminal (SOGT) in Kimanis, Malaysia, and to secure supply to the Labuan Gas Terminal (LGAST) to complement the shortfall of gas from the Kikeh field by 2013. The fields in the Kinabalu (KN) area were discovered in 1989 by Sabah Shell Petroleum Company (SSPC). SSPC has been producing oil from the shallow reservoirs in  the KN Main field since 1997, but the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) is set to expire in 2011. Further exploration by SSPC into the deeper stratigraphic zones has proven the  existence of gas and condensate, in both side of the KN fault, namely the KN East and KN West (formerly known as Deep) reservoirs. SSPC also prepared a Field Development Plan  (FDP) for the non-associated gas (NAG) in KN West and KN East in May 2003. However,  the NAG from these deeper accumulations was relinquished to PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB) in 2003. Pursuant to the above, a team was formed in September 2006 and  commenced the tasks necessary to pursue the development of the Kinabalu NAG (KNAG)  field. The KNAG field is located in Sub-Block 6S-23 in SB-1 PSC, 55 km northwest of Labuan offshore Sabah in 54 m of water. In addition to the KN East and KN West reservoirs,  un-appraised KN Ultra Deep reservoirs exist at depths of more than 4,800 m. The KN West  reservoirs also straddle the Malaysia-Brunei border."
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"To meet the business objectives, the KNAG Development Project will be developed in two phases:  • Phase 1: Start production from KN East and KN West to secure 300 MMscfd of gas supply to SOGT • Phase 2: Develop High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) facilities and produce from the Ultra Deep reservoirs to sustain the supply of 300 MMscfd of gas "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,The KNAG Development Project is part of the Sabah and Sarawak Integrated Oil and
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Gas Project (SSIOGP). The total project cost is estimated at RM6,747 million with 1,031 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas from the East, West, and Ultra Deep reservoirs. The project was authorised on 25 September 2008 without the approval of the Field Development Plan (FDP). According to the team, the FDP will not be approved until further work and studies have been incorporated from the recent appraisal well (KN-E04). The project team is currently updating the FDP.  "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"First gas from the KNAG Development Project is currently scheduled for 31 March 2013 (this was originally planned for September 2009, was later revised to September 2010,  and was then moved to May 2011 at project authorisation). For more details on the history of  the KNAG Development Project, refer to Appendix A. SUBSURFACE DESCRIPTION The KN area consists of four distinct fields: KN Main, East, West (Deep), and Ultra Deep. The KN Main fault is the main structural element in the area that trends South-West to CONFIDENTIAL  IPA 2 North-East. The KN Main field is an oil field (not included as part of the scope). To the East  (up thrown side) of the KN Main fault lays the KN East field. The reservoir depth ranges from 8,900 to 13,750 ft. The KN West field lies to the down thrown West side of the KN Main fault,  while the Ultra Deep field lies below the KN West field. The main target reservoirs for the KN East field are the W, Y, Z, and AA reservoirs. For KN West, the main target will be the U, V,  and W reservoirs. The entire 5,000 m of drilled sediment through zones A to CC is a series of offshore  stacked sands, siltstones, and shales. The sedimentology is considered relatively simple and  is characterised by a predominance of coarsening upward stacked fine grained sandstones  with interbedded shales."
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"The lack of essential reservoir engineering data from Shell, such as well test data, a detailed Pressure Volume Temperature (PVT) report, field prints of the formation pressure data, and particularly cores in the KN West and KN East reservoirs, results in large subsurface uncertainties. Therefore, a number of approved appraisal wells have been developed that will later be converted to producer wells.  "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Based on pressure data from the appraisal well KN-E4, which was drilled in late 2009, KN West may potentially be depleted from the adjacent field in Brunei. The Malaysian  and Brunei governments are currently in negotiations to unitise the fields.

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"PROJECT SCOPE AND DEPLETION PLAN The KNAG Development Project consists of the following scope: Wells Campaign A total of 13 development wells will be developed to deplete the KNAG field:    • KN East: five wells (including the suspended appraisal well)   • KN West: four wells (including the suspended appraisal well)   • KN Ultra Deep: four wells To achieve first gas with a throughput capacity of 300 MMscfd, seven to nine wells  are required to be drilled and completed from the KN East and KN West reservoirs, including  the two suspended appraisal wells. Platforms One new production and processing platform, KNPG-B, and one new drilling  platform, KNJT-C, will be installed. The KN East reservoir will be drilled through KNJT-C at a CONFIDENTIAL  IPA 3  depth of 53 m while the KN West and potential Ultra Deep reservoirs will be drilled through KNPG-B at a depth of 59 m. KNPG-B The KNPG-B substructure is an eight-legged structure designed for a water depth of 59 m. The substructure will accommodate the Module Support Frame, 8 modules, a flare  boom, a telecommunication tower, 12 conductors, a Jack-Up Drilling (JUD) rig or Tender- Assisted Drilling (TAD) rig, 3 risers, 2 boat landings, and 2 pedestal cranes.

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Historically, PCSB project execution durations are longer than industry average by 16 percent. This is partly due to the separate lump-sum contracting strategy that has been adopted by PSCB, which separates the detailed engineering scope of work and the procurement, fabrication, and commissioning scopes of work. Typically this should not delay the execution schedule, but PCSB projects that adopted this strategy had to go through the tendering process for the procurement, fabrication, and commissioning scopes of work after the detailed engineering phase. This tendering process can take up to 12 months for complex projects. On average, Industry overlaps detailed engineering and fabrication by about 30 percent. For a PCSB projects, there are no overlap in detailed engineering and fabrication because of the tendering process for the fabrication scope after detailed engineering.

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,The KNAG Development Project evaluation was conducted post-authorisation. The objective for conducting this late evaluation was to assess the level of project definition at authorisation as an academic exercise and to assist the project team during execution. The drivers are related to the potential project outcomes through the Pathway to Success shown in Figure 27.  
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Given the lack of basic data from the aggressive appraisal campaigns in the KNAG fields, the KNAG Development Project was unable to effectively define the subsurface scope and therefore was hindered in obtaining FDP approval from the Petroleum Management Unit (PMU). Having said this, the PMU Milestone Reviews (MR) #2 and #3 (Static and Dynamic reviews, respectively) should have prepared the team for the final review of the FDP at MR #4. Therefore, in part, the team was not given enough guidance in developing the FDP that would shape the entire scope of the KNAG development. To date, the FDP has not been approved by the PMU.

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Inadequate HPHT reservoir definition puts a project at high risk of not meeting its objectives because reservoir understanding is the basis that feeds into the wells and facilities design. Thus, it is not surprising that Facilities FEL (predominately the HPHT scope) was not adequately defined at authorisation and that Wells FEL (for the KN West scope) is constrained by a lack of basic reservoir data.  "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"The KNAG Development Project is considered a megaproject with a number of technical difficulties in both the facilities and wells scopes, particularly related to the design for the HPHT environment. The project team, and PCSB as a whole, has no experience in developing HPHT reservoirs. The lack of integration with other stakeholders e.g., the PMU, operations, line departments, and capability department is a major concern and given the complexities and schedule constraints of this project, the success of the project will depend on improving the communication flow among the resepective stakeholders. This also places more importance on maintaining the well construction team (and growing the team with experienced HPHT staff) and ensuring that communication is maintained with drilling, operations, and subsurface personnel throughout execution.

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,The production platform’s cost is slightly more expensive than the industry average.
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"However, given that the first gas date has shifted from 2011 to 2013, the facilities’ cost may increase (more significantly in a lump-sum environment due to change orders) beyond the authorised budget, which will hurt the project’s cost competitiveness. The tripod platform is more expensive than other similar platforms executed globally. The offshore pipeline cost estimate was set based on old design dimensions and was never updated until the contract was awarded post-authorisation. The higher than industry average facilities scope can be partially attributed to the lack of detail in the cost estimate which likely has significant embedded escalation. The KN East well campaign cost was set conservatively. In fact, given the current estimate (post authorisation), the wells campaign cost is closer to the industry average for similar well designs. With an already high development cost, a possible downgrade in recoverable resources may be detrimental to the project economics.  "

However, because this date was moved to 2013, the execution schedule is considerably longer than industry average. Critical to the schedule is the offshore installation and SIMOPs with drilling. The coordination among the various functions and the on-time sail away of the platforms will be key to maintaining the industry average results.  "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"The KN East well campaign duration is very aggressive, but aligned with historical PCSB well duration estimates. It should be noted that while PCSB tends to set aggressive  schedule targets, the majority of these projects slip those targets due to rig delays or well  operational issues encountered during the campaign.

The project team  should prepare a “what-if” scenario plan with PMU to understand what is really at  stake for the KNAG Development Project before going further forward. A direction  from PMU on the path forward is critical.

The KNAG Development Project is highly dependent on a number of these Sabah and Sarawak projects. The success of the KNAG Development Project is dependent on proactively managing the scheduling interdependencies. The project has already been affected by the bundled contracting strategy with other similar megaprojects and the SOGT first gas date changes. The first gas delay will have significant re-percussion if the team does not carefully monitor and understand the consequences of such delays, in particularly the fabrication yard and installation vessel utilisation which may clash with other projects using the same yard and resources.

It can be argued that the choice of this strategy is within the control of the operator. However, in practice it is often driven by circumstances, including water depth, government or schedule pressure, and fundamental economics. The team performing execution usually has to deal with an appraisal strategy that has been provided to it.  "

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"OUTCOME METRICS IPA has developed a comprehensive set of models that allow a top-down analysis of  project costs and schedules. The costs include project definition, project management,  engineering, materials, installation, and commissioning. The highest level cost benchmark is based on capital cost per barrel for facilities and  drilling. The models compare the project with the industry average capital expenditure per  barrel of oil equivalent ($/BOE). The next level looks at a facilities program cost (concept unspecific), i.e., a  benchmark of the total non-export facility costs. To compare projects consistently, export  costs are always excluded from this metric. On a more detailed level, we benchmark the cost of individual project components,  such as platforms and pipelines. We assess the contingency required for the facilities as a percentage of the base  estimate. We analyse the project’s overall schedule performance. CONFIDENTIAL VII IPA Predictability of project outcomes is also important, so IPA measures both cost and  schedule predictability, as ratios of the outcomes to planned targets. DRIVER METRICS Front-End Loading (FEL) is IPA’s primary driver metric. It is a measure of the level of  definition of a project. Usually FEL is measured at the time of project authorisation, so IPA  can provide benchmarks of project performance against industry average and the range of"

It comprises the optimal level of project definition for adequately reducing risk and uncertainty, constraining cost and value estimates, without over-commitment of funds and erosion of project value. It can be useful to measure FEL at earlier stages in project definition, when analysis of the gaps to Best Practical can be helpful in planning the activities leading up to authorisation. "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"There are four FEL metrics for upstream projects. The three specific discipline  metrics are Reservoir FEL, Well Construction FEL, and Facilities FEL."
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Value Improving Practices (VIPs) are disciplined practices that tend to improve the value of capital projects in the process industries. Certain VIPs are more suited to particular disciplines, although our research has shown benefit from applying the others comprehensively across the whole asset. "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Successful VIPs application requires a formal, disciplined, and documented approach  with measurable results.  For VIPs to have a positive effect on project outcomes, the project  must achieve an advanced level of project definition. Implementing VIPs with below average FEL effectively eliminates the benefits of their use; when FEL is incomplete, project changes  that occur as definition continues alter the basis of the project, thereby eroding the benefits  of having used the VIP. IPA research has revealed the statistical significance of all of the above driver  metrics in affecting project outcomes. EXECUTION DISCIPLINE METRICS The measurement of execution discipline is complex. IPA focuses on a simple set of  execution discipline metrics, which are cost effective to collect, including project manager  continuity, the Project Control Index (PCI), and late design changes. Other elements of execution discipline can be captured through a “lessons learnt”  process. IPA routinely conducts Lessons Learnt Workshops in conjunction with closeout  interviews to help teams identify practices to apply to future projects—the real transferable  lessons learnt.

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"To assess the development costs, we compare the project’s cost per barrel with that of other similarly sized fields. The advantage of the cost per barrel comparison is that it provides a consistent measure across all projects and provides a gauge for the cost effectiveness of a company in developing a field. It also provides a useful reflection on the quality of the asset development system when making critical decisions on asset development and concept type during front-end evaluation.  "

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Low facilities cost per barrel may be caused by development that takes advantage of pre-existing processing facilities. On average, subsea developments have lower $/BOE costs.

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"PIPELINES COST Industry benchmark costs for pipelines are normalised to a scope (length, size, water  depth, and region) similar to the project. Right-of-way costs and associated environmental  and permitting fees are included. Riser costs are excluded from both project costs and from  the model. The model does not explicitly correct for trenching and exotic materials. The model  simply compares the pipelines to others performing similar duties in the region. Other  pipelines may either have to be trenched or made heavier to ensure stability. The choice of exotic materials is made on economic grounds to avoid high corrosion  allowances. Our model is based on projects that did not require exotic pipeline materials, so  we make a manual adjustment to benchmarks for projects for which exotic materials are  essential.

One of the most significant drivers of this model is the estimated cost of the project, which essentially measures the amount of work that has to be performed. The model also takes into consideration the water depth of the project, but does not include any allowance for external factors that may alter the schedule, such as scope changes, cash flow restrictions, labour shortages or stoppages, equipment delivery delays, or unusually bad weather. The model assumes single-shift operations onshore of 40 to 45 hours per week and double 12-hour shifts offshore.  "

Similar to the Component Cost Effectiveness Model, this model predicts how long a drilling program should take based on the way the project has been designed. This can be extremely useful when trying to tell if a project has an aggressive schedule target. There is a popular opinion that, because time-dependent costs are such a large amount of total cost, the duration index should yield the same index as the "

For instance, if a well is directionally complex, a team may have to use more expensive technology to drill highly directional wells, yet the time it takes to drill these wells may not be considerably more than a simple well, depending on the region. SMART wells add considerably to cost, but not necessarily to duration. "

FEL proceeds until the ""right"" project is selected and is not finished until a full plan of development and design-basis package has been completed. FEL as a concept includes reservoir evaluation, and project and well definition and design.  "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"IPA has developed FEL Indices to consistently measure the level of definition  achieved during FEL. For upstream projects, IPA has developed three discipline FEL Indices, for (1) Reservoir, (2) Facilities and (3) Well Construction. All FEL Indices have a  scale from 3.00 to 12.00, with 3.00 representing the most advanced level of definition and 12.00 representing just a sketchy outline of project intent with no formal definition work done.  (For illustrative purposes, the scale is often truncated at 9.00 in IPA reports and  presentations.) To achieve the extreme FEL rating of 3.00, a team would have to ensure that all FEL  components are completed to a Definitive level, including reservoir appraisal, well and facility  engineering, and regulatory requirements, which requires that all permits are in hand. However, at the time of authorisation, such goals are neither realistic nor necessary."
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Consequently, for each FEL Index, IPA has identified the range of Best Practical values at authorisation. For example, engineering would be only 10 to 30 percent completed—with good participation and buy-in of all team members—and the team would have identified all environmental issues and applied for the required permits, but not necessarily received the permits.

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"A systematic set of activities led by a facilitator to clearly define development wells in a way that is aligned with the company’s strategic business objectives and depletion plan. This practice should establish the optimal technical basis of well and completion design. It employs reservoir characterisation and other relevant subsurface data in conjunction with safety, health and environmental effects, development concept, expected asset life, applicable regulations and standards, and operation environment.

2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"Loading (FEL) and execution phases of a project. The objective of project control is to establish and maintain a disciplined approach to managing work activities during execution so that planned project outcomes are achieved. Project control is a process whereby effective cost and schedule performance baseline plans are established (planning, estimating, and scheduling), measurements of performance against the plan are made and evaluated (progressing and forecasting), and corrective action is taken (change management) when measures indicate a deviation from the plan is occurring or is likely to occur. "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"During FEL, project control focuses on establishing a cost estimate and schedule that are suitable not only as a basis for project decisions, but also as a basis for control of project activities. A strong control basis supports the achievement of Best Practical FEL. During execution, project control focuses on measurement and reporting of progress, forecasting, and change management. The PCI quantifies the strength of the planned or actual practices. "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,Table 23 shows the components of the PCI. Table 23 Components of the Project Control Index PCI Component Elements of Project Control Estimating for Control Estimating and Scheduling Methodology  • Definiteness of estimating methods (including contingency estimate)  • Level of detail for each cost category (including owner costs)   • Degree of cost and schedule integration  • Consistency with latest design Estimate Validation and Review Process  • Extent of estimate review and quantitative validation   • Owner cost knowledge brought to review and validation practices Control During Execution Measurement of Progress   • Extent that physical progressing was performed  • Level of detail of measurements for each cost category Reporting of Progress and Status  • Frequency that project progress and status were reported  • Level of detail of progress reporting for each cost category Owner Participation in Project Control  • Owner control specialist’s responsibilities were defined  • Level of involvement of owner project control specialists Collection of Cost and Schedule Data at Closeout  • Extent and level of detail of historical database to support planning
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"The PCI has four ratings: Good, Fair, Poor, and Deficient. A Good rating indicates that all of the elements for effective project control are in place or were used with fairly robust methods, detail, and so on. A Fair rating indicates that one or more of the elements is not in place or was not used, or that the methods and detail employed were not robust. A "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,Poor rating indicates that several of the elements for effective project control are missing or  were not used. A Deficient rating indicates that elements for effective project control are not  in place or were not used. CONFIDENTIAL XX IPA APPENDIX H: COST ADJUSTMENTS
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"All projects in the IPA database have estimates, and if applicable, actual cost data, in local currency money of the day. To compare any project with other similar projects in IPA’s databases, we have to adjust all the costs to constant year United States (U.S.) dollars. The baseline year we currently use is 2003. "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"For actual costs, normalisation is done in the following steps: For each expenditure category, we apply a standard S-curve expenditure distribution, which yields expenditures for each month. Those monthly expenditures are converted from local currency to U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate of the month. We then de-escalate the U.S. dollar amounts to the year 2003 on a cost category basis using public and IPA escalation data for the month. "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"For estimates, the normalisation is similar. We remove any escalation included in the estimate. We convert from local currency to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the estimate. Finally, we de-escalate the U.S. dollar amounts to the year 2003 on a cost category basis using publicly available escalation data. "
2015 KNAG PRO (Rev Final).pdf,"All IPA models, benchmarks, and statistical analyses are performed using constant 2003 U.S. dollars. From any result, in constant 2003 U.S. dollars, we generate an index  being the ratio of project cost to the database benchmark: Index = Project Cost ( 2003US$)    Benchmark (2003US$) In our reports and presentations, however, we present our results in terms that are  comparable to the local currency money of the day, either as spent or as estimated. To generate the benchmarks in local currency money of the day, we divide the  project figures by the relevant index: Benchmark (local currency money of the day) =      = Project Cost (Local currency money of the day)    Index (2003US$)      = Project Cost (Local currency money of the day) X Benchmark (2003US$)   Project Cost (2003US$) Because the above procedure effectively re-escalates and converts back to local  currency, project teams can recognise the estimates and costs presented in our reports and  presentations, and also make direct comparisons with the benchmarks in local currency  money of the day. We recognise that, with this methodology, short-term currency fluctuations can have  a minor influence on benchmarks for projects that account in currencies other than the U.S.  dollar.

2015 Samarang EOR PRO (Final).pdf,PETRONAS projects with reimbursable components encountered procurement delays associated with the lack of familiarity from both the owner and contractors on each other’s procurement and finance processes. The project’s lack of schedule activity detail in procurement provides a poor basis to manage reimbursable materials procurement.  
2015 Samarang EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"Recommendations Based on our analysis, we offer the following recommendations to help the project team and the business  improve the likelihood of project success: 1. Leverage lessons learnt from projects that used reimbursable contracts PETRONAS has made limited use of reimbursable contracts in past projects, which resulted in cost  savings, but also highlighted process and system deficiencies that led to delayed procurement. Learning from past experience will help realise the potential reimbursable contracting brings. 2. Increase the schedule detail for the procurement phase Procurement activities in the schedule reflect the bulk materials and equipment packages, but do not  distinguish between those that are under lump-sum contracts and those that are reimbursable. Increasing procurement activity detail will provide a better basis for project controls and allow for  physical progressing of the reimbursable materials, in particular. 3. Increase owner procurement personnel resources in anticipation of the greater workload There are many stages that the PETRONAS procurement process requires to issue a purchase  order. Contractors unfamiliar with these internal audit requirements may not include these durations in  their schedule and, as such, may need owner assistance in expediting the process. 4. Plan for longer procurement durations Given that this project will represent the project team’s first experience with reimbursable-style  contracting elements, the team should increase the amount of float in the procurement phase to  account for any unexpected delays. 5. Consider reducing contingency in line with Best Practical engineering definition"

2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"Developing an asset from exploration discovery to production is a complex process involving, in effect, three projects executed by several different functional areas that must be coordinated. At a basic level, developing an asset requires the execution of a (1) reservoir evaluation project, (2) development drilling project, and (3) facilities construction project. Achieving excellence on any one of these complex projects in isolation is a challenge. Achieving excellence in asset performance requires individual project excellence as well as excellence in multi-project integration and cross-functional coordination. It also requires following a defined sequence of activities. IPA developed a suite of benchmarking metrics to help its clients understand project outcomes and the drivers of those outcomes. The suite includes metrics for the project at the asset level, for the various disciplines whose combined efforts merge to deliver the project, and for the physical components that make up the asset.

These two independent metrics  comprise assessment of many factors to provide an expression of project complexity. The RCI components encompass structural and stratigraphic complexity, rock and fluid quality, and  reservoir drive energy. The WCI considers subsurface hazards, reservoir interfaces, well geometry,  equipment required, and the operational environment. CONFIDENTIAL 3 IPA Driver Metrics IPA has identified Appraisal Philosophy or strategy—how much time and money a company is willing to  spend on understanding the reservoir—as a factor affecting both project drivers and project outcomes. This is often driven by circumstances, including water depth, government or schedule pressure, and  fundamental economics. The execution team usually has to deal with an appraisal strategy provided to it. However, operators almost always have some degree of choice in Appraisal Philosophy."

Frequently, we observe highly complex developments being done in an ad hoc fashion. When we observe all the disciplines of a project team working together in a structured framework, we credit the project for Team Integration. "
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"Front-End Loading (FEL) is IPA’s primary driver metric. It measures project definition. Usually FEL is measured at project sanction, so IPA can provide benchmarks of project performance against industry average and Best Practical FEL, which differs for each FEL Index. It comprises the optimal project definition for adequately reducing risk and uncertainty and constraining cost and value estimates, without over-commitment of funds and erosion of project value. It can be useful to measure FEL at earlier stages in project definition, when analysis of the gaps to Best Practical can be helpful in planning activities leading up to sanction. "

2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"Execution Discipline Metrics The measurement of execution discipline is complex. IPA focuses on a simple set of execution discipline  metrics, which are cost effective to collect, including project manager continuity, the Project Control Index  (PCI), and major late changes. Outcome Metrics IPA has developed a comprehensive set of models that allow a top-down analysis of project costs and  schedules. The costs include project definition, project management, engineering, materials, installation,  and commissioning. The highest level cost benchmark is based on capital cost per barrel for facilities and drilling. The models  compare the project with the industry average capital expenditure per barrel of oil equivalent ($/BOE). The next level looks at a facilities program cost (concept unspecific); that is, it benchmarks the total non- export facility costs. To compare projects consistently, export costs are always excluded from this metric. On a more detailed level, we benchmark the cost of individual project components, such as platforms and  pipelines. CONFIDENTIAL 4 IPA We assess the contingency required for the facilities as a percentage of the base estimate for onshore  projects. We analyze the project’s schedule performance. Predictability of project outcomes is also important, so IPA measures both cost and schedule predictability  against planned targets. Finally, we measure outcomes that show how the asset has performed against expectations including  production attainment, resource promise estimate (RPE) predictability, and operability issues. These  measures are typically not known until one year or more after startup. CONFIDENTIAL 5 IPA IPA’s Project Database"
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"The IPA proprietary E&P Database serves as the basis for IPA’s analysis. The database contains information on over 1,400 upstream projects and more than 40 project systems. The database covers the life cycle of projects from the start of appraisal through the first several years of operation. Projects in the database represent a wide cross-section of offshore and onshore exploration and production facilities. For all projects in the database, there are over 2,000 variables describing the history of the projects from conception through early production. More specifically, the data include: basic characteristics – location, size, concept type; planned and actual schedules; detailed technical information; technical problems and challenges encountered early in design; scope changes; status of project definition; project management characteristics; cost estimation histories and actual expenditures; and external factors affecting the project (e.g., natural disasters, labor strikes, material shortages, and unanticipated regulatory changes).

The Project Evaluation System (PES®)1 methodology is quantitative, empirical, and objective in its approach, and thus provides a credible way to benchmark and compare project practices and results. Empiricism is necessary because project systems are so complex that it is impossible to understand every facet of a system on first principles. However, project histories in the databases act as clear guides to understanding and quantifying the relationship between project practices and project outcomes. Through our statistical research using these data, IPA has identified the key success factors associated with excellent projects.  "

Factors such as project cost, location, use of new technology, technical complexity, and percent of revamp affect outcomes such as project cost, schedule, and operational performance to varying degrees. Based on these findings, we extract from the larger database a subset of projects to be the basis of comparison for the project being analyzed. "
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"When developing a comparison dataset for the cost analysis, it is more important to find projects with similar scope (facility concept) and characteristics (such as water depth, reservoir and well complexity, etc.) than projects of similar cost. Project cost has been found to be a strong driver of schedule duration (as discussed in the schedule model sections), so the cost range generally is much narrower when a comparison set is created specifically for the schedule analysis. Should the cost comparison dataset have a narrow enough cost range that is comparable to the project (often the case when project costs are industry average), one dataset may be used for both the cost and schedule analyses. "
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"We typically use the comparison dataset to validate the industry benchmarks of the cost and schedule  models, to conduct a cost ratio analysis, to benchmark FEL duration, analyze specialized scope  elements, and to compare RPE predictability and production attainment. CONFIDENTIAL 7 IPA Cost Normalization All projects in the IPA database have estimates and (if applicable) actual cost data in local currency  money of the day. To compare any project with similar projects in IPA databases, we adjust all costs to  constant year United States (U.S.) dollars. The baseline year we currently use is 2003."
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"For actual costs, normalization is done in the following steps: For each expenditure category, we apply a standard S-curve expenditure distribution, which yields expenditures for each month. Those monthly expenditures are converted from local currency to U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate of the month. We then de-escalate the U.S. dollar amounts to the year 2003 on a cost category basis using escalation data. "
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"For estimates, the normalization is similar. We remove any escalation in the estimate. We convert from  local currency to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate at the time of the estimate. Finally, we de-escalate the U.S. dollar amounts to the year 2003 on a cost category basis using public and IPA escalation data for the  month. All IPA models, benchmarks, and statistical analyses are done using constant 2003 U.S. dollars. From  any result, in constant 2003 U.S. dollars, we generate an index as the ratio of project cost to the database  benchmark: Index = Project Cost (2003US$) Benchmark (2003US$) In our reports and presentations, however, we present our results in terms comparable to the local  currency money of the day, either as spent or as estimated. To generate the benchmarks in local currency money of the day, we divide the project figures by the  relevant index: Benchmark (local currency money of the day) =       = Project Cost (local currency money of the day) Index (2003US$)      = Project Cost (local currency money of the day) X Benchmark (2003US$) Project Cost (2003US$)"
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"Because the above procedure effectively re-escalates and converts back to local currency, project teams can recognize the estimates and costs in our reports and presentations, and also make direct comparisons with the benchmarks in local currency money of the day.

There are two goals of normalizing cost: • Ensure a fair and appropriate comparison of outcomes―By removing, or making neutral, effects outside the project team’s (system’s) control, we can ensure that cost competitiveness and predictability metrics are compared on an “apples-to-apples” basis.  • Identify Best Practices―By controlling for events outside the team’s (system’s) control, IPA can identify project practices the team (system) can control that improve performance.

2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"The major reason we base our analysis in 2003 is because of the significant price increases for many bulk materials, equipment, and other cost categories since 2003. Most of the price increases were triggered by increases in steel prices in late 2003 and accelerating market demand, especially in the subsea equipment and drilling rig market. Because the price increases have been very item specific, we have changed our data collection approach so we obtain details about the specific concepts actually being installed. For projects collected more recently, we better understand the concepts and markets and are therefore better able to adjust for recent inflation trends. For older projects, we did not always collect the detail of data for each project because markets were stable over time. Basically, we believe it is more accurate to adjust recent projects to January 2003 because we better understand the mix of materials for those projects. As we gather more data and update our models, we will drop older observations from the models and establish a new baseline period for our analysis. "

The same normalization factor is used to adjust FEL, project management, and detailed engineering costs. We believe this is reasonable because the market for engineering skills is somewhat fungible across regional markets.  • Construction Labor: Construction labor costs are normalized using a factor that is the product of the relative wages and productivity for the region at the time of expenditure to the base location and time period (e.g., USGC and January 2003). These factors are based on information in the "

IPA employs a methodology for normalizing equipment by taking into account the project’s scope. For example, large fabricated equipment has had a different escalation pattern than electronic equipment. We track several categories of equipment and normalize cost by developing a composite escalation factor based on the specific project scope. • Transportation, Integration, and Installation: Many projects fabricate entire facilities or substantive components in one or more sites distant from the final installation and may need to transport and integrate all or part of the facility in a different site, most frequently by sea. The vessels used to transport these facility components are also often used in the final installation. "

Note: "
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"Transportation of certain materials to site for final installation (pipeline, well trees, etc.) does not usually require such specialized vessels and is normalized using WOM trends.   • Subsea Hardware and Equipment Costs: The market for subsea hardware and equipment is characterized by a limited number of suppliers and continuous technological innovation and has not tracked with other material and equipment trends for steel and fabrication. Therefore, the normalization curves for subsea equipment reflect market trends identified by IPA data and public information. IPA conducted a study specifically to characterize the escalation trends for projects with subsea components.   • Well Drilling and Completion Costs: The cost of well construction is substantially controlled by the daily rate paid for the drilling rig(s). Often only certain equipment is capable of the work for a given project. The market for these rigs can be highly volatile and may be pre-determined by long-term contracts. IPA obtains daily rig rate cost data from several industry sources for all types and ages of rigs. We normalize costs to these sources, based on the type of rig used in the project.

For contingency and lump-sum costs, it is often not possible or practical to understand the cost split of the items included. Therefore, to normalize costs, we use our database to identify historical patterns and then allocate contingency and lump-sum costs to other categories (such as labor, materials, etc.).  "

Fundamental system design is still within the  scope of existing technology. New Technology Project incorporates new and radically different system design. Wells Complexity and Technology Well complexity is an indication of the difficulty of the well construction program in the project location and  as designed by the team—it helps us quantify the team’s understanding of the chosen program. Unlike

Because a different operator may chose a different well construction program (dry tree vs. wet tree, vertical vs. horizontal wells, etc.), many elements of the WCI might be more or less complex for the selected design, and with a different WCI. Incomplete or improper characterization of complexity can lead to suboptimal programs that might be costly to implement or may have to change during execution.  "

A more complex well program often requires more complex technology, both of which introduce risk to the project, but may offer cost or time savings. Thus risk to the project is identified principally by WCI, unless the technology selection is out-of-step with the WCI. One area where this may occur is in ultra-deepwater projects (greater than about 5,000 feet). The WCI increases due to the well and water depths, pressures, and rig equipment required, but the use of technology may still be considered less of a risk. "
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"Another consideration in technology selection is the trade-off between facilities and wells. Trade-offs are necessary for any optimization effort, but while the focus in technology selection for one area may optimize that part, it may be sub-optimal for the project as a whole.

Contingency Allowance Model What Is Contingency?"
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"One of the primary areas of concern within a company’s project system is the assignment of reliable contingency allowances in project cost estimates. Appropriate contingency that reflects project risks allows a better understanding of the likely project costs. Ideally, the base estimate (i.e., the estimate without contingency) should include the costs of known items, and the contingency allowance should cover the costs of unknown items. The contingency allowance should then provide a determinable level of confidence that the total cost estimate, including contingency, will not be overrun because of unpredictable, although not extraordinary, events. Contingency is not intended to provide a guarantee that the total project cost of a project will not exceed its authorized budget. Instead, contingency represents an allowance of funds to achieve a desired probability that a cost overrun will not occur. "
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"Setting the contingency too high or too low costs money. If contingency is too high, project teams or management have a strong tendency to consume some or even all of the appropriated money on items outside the authorized scope. If contingency is set too low, the project will have unrealistic budgets that will tend to drive the team to pursue risky, ineffective, or inefficient execution practices to meet the unrealistic target (in other words, the project is more likely to lose control). Setting contingency too low tends to erode cost discipline and can lead to time wasted on creative accounting. Reductions in scope and/or the rejection of desirable design improvements can result. "
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"Contingency is closely related to, but distinct from, allowances, such as material take-off allowances or allowances for the event of extreme weather. Contingency is not a reserve or slush fund that the project team cannot spend on the authorized project scope without upper management approval. Likewise, management should not have the expectation that, if a project team does its job well, contingency will not be spent. Both of these views contribute to distortion of the base estimate. When repeated throughout a project system, this distortion makes prediction of total system expenditure difficult.  "

2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,Approaches to assigning contingency are often arbitrary and fail to adjust for the status of project definition at the time of estimate preparation. IPA has developed a systematic method of determining the contingency required for a project based on a parametric statistical model. We formulated this model by collecting detailed histories of projects and identifying key factors that drive differences between project estimates and actual cost outcomes. 
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"IPA’s Approach to Contingency IPA’s statistical model, called the Contingency Allowance Model (CAM), is used to provide an industry  benchmark of the contingency required to achieve various levels of confidence of overrun or underrun."

2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"Projects executed using lump-sum contracts typically require less explicit contingency than other contracting strategies. Lump-sum contracts move much of a project’s risk from the owner to the contractor, who then compensates by adding contingency to the bid price. Execution strategy affects contingency use because, if a project is cost driven, it is less likely to take actions and make changes that will put cost at risk.

2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,"If a company cost culture is one that strives to achieve aggressive, but realistic, targets and expects that some cost overruns will occur (without punishment), more contingency may be required because less “fat” is in the base estimate to cover uncertainties.

Total Materials Cost Effectiveness Model"
2015 Samarang EOR PRO Metrics and Analysis Guide.pdf,The total installed cost for a project is often the overwhelming factor in determining the life cycle cost or return on investment (ROI). Lower relative installed cost places a company in an advantageous position in which the company is able to gain market share and still be profitable during price downturns. Being a low-cost producer is essential to maintain long-term profitability.

Depressed oil prices have led to PCSB re-evaluating its 2015 project pipeline and withdrawing advance funding for the project. FEL has continued on the basis that FID is taken per existing plans.

2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"CONFIDENTIAL v IPA EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PROJECT OVERVIEW This report presents our evaluation of the PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB) Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project drivers, cost, schedule, and performance risks. At the time  of this evaluation, the Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project was in mid-FEL 3 with a deterministic  planned final investment decision (FID) date of June 2015 and a risked p80 FID date of October 2015. The project’s budget is estimated at RM2,000 million4. The Samarang field is located offshore Sabah, Malaysia, 49 km northwest of Labuan. The field is in 8 to 50 m water depth and was discovered in 1972. First oil was achieved in 1975 and the field has been in production for 40 years. The Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project  involves implementing gravity-assisted simultaneous water and gas injection (GASWAG), a New-to-Industry enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique, over the Samarang M and N  reservoir sands. The project is expected to recover additional resource promise ranging from 21.5 million barrels (MMbbls) to 29.5 MMbbls depending on the GASWAG efficacy. The RPE  base case is 25.5 MMbbls."
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"The Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project involves a split5 12-well drilling campaign, an offshore revamp scope, and installation of new infield pipelines. The well program consists of three water injection wells, three gas injection wells, and six oil producers, drilled from existing wellhead platforms (WHPs). The offshore revamp scope comprises installation of deck extensions, topsides, and equipment modifications to support the well program and enable the supply of injection gas and water from the nearby Sumandak asset. Two rigid and two flexible infield pipelines will transport water and gas from Sumandak to the respective WHPs hosting the injection wells. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"The overall contracting strategy (OCS) relies on existing PCSB-contractors as much as possible to improve contract utilisation. Contractors for the offshore revamp and pipeline scopes and drilling services will be sole-sourced and called off from existing agreements. The rig contracting strategy has yet to be finalised at time of evaluation, with PCSB exploring several options, including a rig already under contract (if available) or tendering in the open market.

The decision to take project FID in 2015 both within PCSB and the PCSB/Schlumberger Alliance had not been made at time of evaluation, and is a major factor that may challenge existing execution planning assumptions. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"Funding. Approved advance funding has been withdrawn as part of the project portfolio  review, which necessitates an update to execution planning. Purchase orders for long-lead  items for facilities and well scopes for the p50 schedule is based on the assumption that project FID is taken in June 2015. Should advance funding not be reinstated by July 2015, the current  p80 schedule will be invalidated. Funding for the project team for the rest of 2015 is also in  question and raises the possibility of team discontinuity."
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"Execution planning gaps. The basis for pipeline installation does not reflect current norms. The integrated schedule reflects 3 days of installation for the 16-inch pipeline that includes crossings. The estimated duration for the crossings alone per pipeline is closer to 30 days and is not reflected in the schedule. A shallow draft pipelay vessel is also required for the installation campaign, and availability at the time of evaluation is assumed. Weak or outdated basis for execution planning increases the probability for cost and schedule deviation and eventual outcomes. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"Project path forward is unclear. The outcome of PCSB’s portfolio review is likely to be straightforward: recycle, put on hold, or proceed. The path forward is less clear, however, with respect to the PCSB-Schlumberger alliance, production sharing contract (PSC) extension and effect on what is acknowledged as a time-sensitive EOR project.

The Samarang field is located offshore Sabah, Malaysia, 49 km northwest of Labuan. The field has been in production for almost 40 years and PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd  (PCSB) is the operator. The mature field is forecast to become uneconomic by 2017 due to  declining production if no further development effort is made. The Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project involves implementing gravity-assisted simultaneous water and gas injection  (GASWAG), a New-to-Industry enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique, over the Samarang M and N reservoir sands. The project is expected to recover additional reserves ranging from 21.5 million barrels (MMbbls) to 29.5 MMbbls depending on GASWAG efficacy. The resource  promise estimate (RPE) base case is 25.5 MMbbls."
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,The business objective for the Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project is to successfully implement EOR technology as part of the alliance with Schlumberger. Project economics need to clear the investment hurdle rate of 10 percent internal rate of return (IRR) while maximising value from the mature Samarang field. The project is also expected to achieve best-in-class performance. Project objectives include commencing first water injection by October 2016 and keeping capital expenditure within Malaysian ringgit (RM) 2 billion.

2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project had been originally part of a broader field redevelopment first conceptualised in 2007 and endorsed in 2009. This development would be split into two phases. Phase 1 included the drilling of five wells to prove an attic oil concept and gather data for the Phase 2 EOR scope. Phase 2 also included an infill well program alongside EOR implementation.  
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"In 2011, PCSB separated the infill wells scope from EOR implementation, choosing to proceed with the infill wells and defer EOR implementation to further optimise the development concept and reduce cost. Over the course of 2012 and 2013, the EOR project went through multiple FEL 2 recycles, as proposed economics did not meet PCSB investment criteria. New wellhead platform (WHP) facilities scopes were removed to reduce capital expenditure, and alternate sources of injection water and gas were studied. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"FIELD HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION The Samarang field was discovered in 1972 with the SM-1 well. The field covers an  area of approximately 7 by 2 km and is located in the eastern part of the Baram Delta province. Water depths range from 8 to 50 meters. First oil was achieved in June 1975 with Shell as  operator. Samarang reservoirs (E to S sequence) are between 1,500 and 8,000 ft (subsurface)."
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"They consist of a series of alternating sand, silts, and clays of Late Miocene to Early Pliocene age deposited in a subtidal shallow marine environment. The main hydrocarbon accumulations are located within the J, K, and M reservoirs. The field is divided vertically into shallow, intermediate, and deep sequences. The shallow sequence consists inclusively of reservoirs from C to I markers. The intermediate includes reservoirs from J and K markers, and the deep consists of reservoirs below K reservoirs.  "

2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"The Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project focuses on recovering remaining oil from the M and N reservoirs, targeting a total of seven layers. The M and N markers start at 5,950 ft (subsurface) and are subdivided into six layers: M1, M3, M4, M5, M6, and M7 sands, separated by shale or non-reservoir rock. Average porosity for the M and N sands range between 13 and 24 percent. The M reservoir is characterised by a large gas cap and intermediate water drive. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"Oil properties in Samarang field vary accordingly with depth, with about 20º API units  in the shallow reservoirs to about 37º API in the deeper reservoirs. M and N are considered  the deeper reservoirs with lighter 36º API oil and a gas‒oil ratio of 730 standard cubic feet per  barrel (scf/bbl). PROJECT SCOPE AND DEPLETION PLAN The Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project comprises brownfield modifications on the SMDP-B, SMJT-E, and SUPG-B platforms, new infield pipelines to transport injection water  and gas from Sumandak facilities, and a 12-well program. Brownfield modifications: There are two main scopes: (1) deck extensions on the SMJT-E platform, simultaneous production and drilling (SIPROD) preparation and installation  of conductor guides on the SMDP-B platform; and (2) topsides/equipment modifications  including water injection booster pumps and modifications of a gas compressor on the SUPG- B platform, a thermal electric generator (TEG) on the SMDP-B and SMJT-E platforms,  installation of new pig launchers and receivers on SUPG-B, SMDP-B, and SMJT-E platforms. Infield pipelines: Two rigid, 8-inch carbon steel pipelines approximately 14 km in  length between SUPG-B and SMDP-B platforms and two 6.7-inch flexible pipelines  approximately 2 km between SMDP-B and SMJT-E platforms."
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"Twelve-well program: The program consists of six producer wells, three water injection wells, and three gas injection wells. Four producer wells will be drilled on satellite platform SMJT-G. Two 36-inch conductors with dual trees will host two wells each. The other two producer wells drilled on the SMDP-B platform will use new, individual 26-inch conductors. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"Existing wells will be plugged and abandoned with coiled tubing and killed with a cement plug  to make way for the producers. All injector wells will be sidetracks off existing wells. All wells  will have 13-5/8 inch intermediate casing and 9-5/8 production casing. CONTRACTING STRATEGY The OCS was based around a competitive tender for the brownfield platform  modifications lump-sum EPCC (engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning)  contract with all other scopes using existing price (frame) agreements with PCSB. The OCS has gone through multiple revisions as the project’s scope concept evolved  over time. The fourth revision OCS at the time of evaluation was pending submission for  regulatory approval with Malaysia Petroleum Management (MPM)."
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"On 8 December 2014, the OCS was revised for the fifth time following a high-level management decision. The EPCC contract would no longer be competitively bid but sole-sourced to an existing PCSB hook-up and commissioning (HUC) contractor—the likely contract recipient. This contractor services PCSB in the Sabah region and has had manpower constraints in the past. Crews were rotated between projects, and this is a known issue. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"CONFIDENTIAL 3 IPA Detailed engineering for the rigid pipeline scope was also to be separated from the  brownfield modifications contract and given to an existing PCSB pipeline contractor  responsible for pipeline replacements across the company. The engineering contractor responsible for FEED for the brownfield modifications and  infield pipelines is also to be responsible for detailed design for the deck extensions and SIPROD preparations. The EPCC HUC contractor is expected to take over approved-for- construction (AFC) drawings for the brownfield modifications scope through to HUC. The pipeline replacement project contractor is responsible for detailed engineering for  the rigid pipeline scope. Line pipe will be sourced under an existing price agreement with Prime Source International, and transportation and installation (T&I) covered under the Pan Malaysia contract. The EPCC HUC contractor is responsible for the rigid pipeline HUC. Technip will be responsible for the entire flexible pipeline scope. Installation of the  pipeline requires a vessel capable of operating in less than 10 m water depth. Technip does  not have such a vessel in its fleet, thus it will need to be outsourced. At the time of evaluation, the rig had not been decided, with options for either an  existing PCSB-contracted rig or tendering for a new jack-up rig. Drilling services will be  provided by existing agreements between PCSB and Schlumberger. The latest revision of the OCS obtained internal PCSB approval on 14 January 2015.

The Samarang M and N reservoir  sands are more complex than the industry average, as shown in Figure 4. The Samarang field in general is highly faulted, structurally divided into four areas―the  northern culmination, central collapse, East Flank, and West Flank. The M and N reservoirs  are found in the West Flank. Large faults could be located during geophysical interpretation. Smaller faults have had to be identified through advanced “seismic ant tracking,” analysing  directional discontinuity features of seismic amplitude data. Identification of these smaller  faults has historically been difficult."

2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"An effective appraisal programme materially increases the RPE reliability for a given asset development. To characterise the effectiveness of the Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project appraisal program in increasing its RPE reliability, we assess five factors: (1) reservoir complexity, (2) quality of seismic imaging, (3) reservoir properties, (4) geologic properties, and (5) fluid properties. We discuss the Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project AEI components below.  Reservoir complexity: The RCI, as was described previously, is considerably higher than Industry average.  Seismic imaging quality: The Samarang M and N reservoirs have Moderate quality seismic. Major fault lines could be manually picked out, smaller scale faults were identified through ant-tracking analysis on the data and not directly observable from seismic. Over 140 wells provide control for the structure.  Geologic static properties: Static modelling is rated Moderate. Residual oil saturation ranges between 5 and 25 percent. Original oil‒water contacts are known but the current contact across the M and N sands is inferred from production information, surveillance data, and data from reservoir saturation tools. Logging will be used during the drilling campaign to update this information.  Fluid properties: Fluid properties are rated Definitive. M and N sands have a long production history with oil, gas, and water samples from all major units having undergone analysis, including PVT/phase behaviour and geochemical and recombination studies.  Reservoir dynamic properties: Dynamic modelling is rated Moderate. Dynamic modelling for the M and N reservoirs was to be updated using relative permeability results from the SCAL study done from 2012 to mid-2013. The earlier study was not successful and a new study was initiated, with results expected by end of 2015. "

VIPs use is correlated with successful outcomes. IPA recognises a suite of Asset VIPs, Facilities VIPs, and Subsurface VIPs that, when used  appropriately, plays a significant role in E&P project definition. See the Value Improving Practices Appendix for more detailed information on VIPs. Industry Average PETRONAS Average Samarang Ph2 EOR Project 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Percentage of Opportunities Facilities VIPs Use Recommended Range Figure 13 Figure 13 shows that the facilities team used 40 percent of the Asset and Facilities VIPs applicable to the Samarang Phase 2 EOR Project. The subsurface team applied four VIPs out of six of Subsurface VIPs (SSVIPs), or 67 percent. IPA research has shown that by sanction, the optimal use of applicable Asset and Facilities VIPs is 30 to 60 percent. This suggests that teams should develop plans to select  and use VIPs during FEL 2 and FEL 3. However, Subsurface VIPs (SSVIPs) have little overlap  in the type of work they perform; therefore, there is no maximum suggested uptake of SSVIPs.

2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"Successful VIPs application requires a structured, disciplined, and documented  approach with measured results. For VIPs to have a positive effect on project outcomes, the  project must achieve advanced project definition. Implementing VIPs with below average FEL CONFIDENTIAL III IPA   effectively eliminates the benefits of their use; when FEL is incomplete, project changes that  occur as definition continues alter the basis of the project, thereby eroding the benefits of  having used the VIP. EXECUTION DISCIPLINE METRICS The measurement of execution discipline is complex. IPA focuses on a simple set of  execution discipline metrics, which are cost effective to collect, including project manager  continuity, the Project Control Index (PCI), and major late changes. Other elements of execution discipline can be captured through a “lessons learned”  process. IPA routinely conducts Lessons Learned Workshops in conjunction with closeout  interviews to help teams identify practices to apply to future projects—the real transferable  lessons learned. OUTCOME METRICS IPA has developed a comprehensive set of models that allow a top-down analysis of  project costs and schedules. The costs include project definition, project management,  engineering, materials, installation, and commissioning. The highest level cost benchmark is based on capital cost per barrel for facilities and  drilling. The models compare the project with the industry average capital expenditure per  barrel of oil equivalent ($/BOE). The next level looks at a facilities program cost (concept unspecific), i.e., a benchmark  of the total non-export facility costs. To compare projects consistently, export costs are always  excluded from this metric. On a more detailed level, we benchmark the cost of individual project components,  such as platforms and pipelines. We assess the contingency required for the facilities as a percentage of the base  estimate. We analyse the project’s overall schedule performance. Predictability of project outcomes is also important, so IPA measures both cost and  schedule predictability, as ratios of the outcomes to planned targets.

2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"To assess the development costs, we compare the project’s cost per barrel with that of other similarly sized fields. The advantage of the cost per barrel comparison is that it provides a consistent measure across all projects and provides a gauge for the cost effectiveness of a company in developing a field. It also provides a useful reflection on the quality of the asset development system when making critical decisions on asset development and concept type during front-end evaluation.  "

2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"Each of the Value Improving Practices (VIPs) is defined below. However, these definitions do not explain the requirements for successful VIPs application. Successful VIPs application requires a structured and documented approach with measured results:  The VIP activities must be scheduled and resourced early during a project's life cycle for these practices to have their maximum effect on project costs. Moreover, resources must be set aside so that the practices may be satisfactorily implemented, perhaps even using individuals external to the project to oversee the application.  The VIP activities must be done thoroughly. For example, ensuring that a project employs the best available technology—the goal of the Technology Selection "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"VIP—requires identification of potential candidates through rigorous patent searches, visits to university research centres and process licensors, and the subsequent evaluation of these candidates. Thorough application of this VIP means that the potential candidates cannot be limited to only those of whom the firm is currently aware.  The VIP must be applied to the full scope of the project (at least initially). Arbitrarily limiting the scope to a portion of the project unnecessarily limits the practices' potential effects.  Guidelines must exist to ensure that each VIP is applied consistently. For example, the guidelines should specify which costs should be evaluated (e.g., total life cycle cost) and which economic and financial assumptions should be used.  The results of VIPs application must be documented. Documentation is performed to provide a basis for the project team to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the practice and to provide lessons learned for future project teams. At a minimum, the following information should be recorded: a description of the activity, the monetary value of the scope work reviewed, the monetary savings achieved, and the cost of applying each VIP.

2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"The Project Control Index (PCI) measures the set of practices by which a project team manages (or plans to manage) cost and schedule performance during the Front-End Loading (FEL) and execution phases of a project. The objective of project control is to establish and maintain a disciplined approach to managing work activities during execution so that planned project outcomes are achieved. Project control is a process whereby effective cost and schedule performance baseline plans are established (planning, estimating, and scheduling), measurements of performance against the plan are made and evaluated (progressing and forecasting), and corrective action is taken (change management) when measures indicate a deviation from the plan is occurring or is likely to occur. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"During FEL, project control focuses on establishing a cost estimate and schedule that are suitable not only as a basis for project decisions, but also as a basis for control of project activities. A strong control basis supports the achievement of Best Practical FEL. During project execution, project control focuses on measurement and reporting of progress, forecasting, and change management. The PCI quantifies the strength of the planned or actual practices. Table 19 shows the components of the PCI. "

2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"All projects in the IPA database have estimates, and if applicable, actual cost data, in local currency money of the day. To compare any project with other similar projects in IPA’s databases, we have to adjust all the costs to constant year United States (U.S.) dollars. The baseline year we currently use is 2003. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"For actual costs, normalisation is done in the following steps: For each expenditure category, we apply a standard S-curve expenditure distribution, which yields expenditures for each month. Those monthly expenditures are converted from local currency to U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate of the month. We then de-escalate the U.S. dollar amounts to the year 2003 on a cost category basis using escalation data. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"For estimates, the normalisation is similar. We remove any escalation included in the estimate. We convert from local currency to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the estimate. Finally, we de-escalate the U.S. dollar amounts to the year 2003 on a cost category basis using public and IPA escalation data for the month. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 EOR PRO (Final).pdf,"All IPA models, benchmarks, and statistical analyses are performed using constant 2003 U.S. dollars. From any result, in constant 2003 U.S. dollars, we generate an index being  the ratio of project cost to the database benchmark: Index = Project Cost (2003US$) Benchmark (2003US$) In our reports and presentations, however, we present our results in terms that are  comparable to the local currency money of the day, either as spent or as estimated. To generate the benchmarks in local currency money of the day, we divide the project  figures by the relevant index: Benchmark (local currency money of the day) =      = Project Cost (local currency money of the day) Index (2003US$)     = Project Cost (local currency money of the day) X Benchmark (2003US$) Project Cost (2003US$)"

Due to the aging infrastructure and declining production, the field was forecast to become  uneconomic by 2017 if no further development effort was undertaken."

The redevelopment was anticipated to increase recoverable reserves by as much as 105 MMstb by 2035 through infill drilling and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) using gravity-assisted simultaneous water and gas (GASWAG). PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB) and Schlumberger Oilfield Services conducted the work under an alliance contract, which was signed in March 2010. The project was split into two phases. Phase 1 included drilling of the five wells required to prove the attic oil concept used in the SMRF 2 Infill Project, as well as gathering data for the EOR scope and the reservoir management components. Phase 2 consists of the EOR scope and the remaining infill wells. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"Phase 1 was completed in November 2011, and Phase 2 is still ongoing. The Samarang Phase 2 Advanced Drilling (SMRG 2 AD) Project was initiated in early 2012 in  response to a request by PETRONAS Management Unit (PMU) to fast track development to  offset declining domestic oil production under the Crude Oil Initiative [COIN] 2012 program. The scope of the SMRG 2 AD Project included drilling three infill wells and associated offshore  revamp. Two of the three infill wells were originally planned to be part of the SMRG 2 Infill Project. The remainder of the Samarang Redevelopment Phase 2 Project was then further split  into two parts, the infill drilling project and the EOR project. Infill drilling was sanctioned in July 2012 and is the focus of this evaluation; the EOR scope was recycled for economic reasons  and is awaiting approval."

Shell was the previous  operator and relinquished the concession to PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB) in April 1995. The field was developed in phases. Seven platforms were installed including drilling,  wellhead, and processing platforms. Shell planned an additional wellhead platform for the east  flank development, but did not install it because of its low reserves potential. The field achieved first oil in June 1975. From 1975 to 1979, 62 development wells  were drilled on SMDP16-A, B and SMJT17-C, D, E platforms. Several revisits have been made  in the field over the past two decades.:"

2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,The historical drilling results suggest that oil properties in the Samarang field vary with depth with increases from about 20°API in the shallow reservoirs to about 37°API in the deeper reservoirs.

PROJECT SCOPE AND DEPLETION PLAN The planned SMRG 2 Infill scope involved drilling nine infill wells to develop 17.2 MMstb of oil. Associated facilities scope involved infill well tie-ins, brownfield modifications on 10 platforms, and installation of an integrated operations system on 12 platforms. Changes to  planned scope are outlined below. Depletion Plan Description Although nine wells were planned, only seven wells were drilled plus a well workover;  the wells budget did not change. Wells C-03 and C-08 were dropped for economic and risk  profile reasons post authorisation. Facilities Description"
2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"The planned facilities scope involved the tie-in of nine infill wells, modifications on 10 platforms, and installation of an integrated operations (IO) system on 12 platforms for smart field management. In February 2013, a change note was initiated on the platform modification scope that reduced the scope to only six platforms, although (IO) system installation on all 12 platforms was maintained. Several modifications were required for the later EOR implementation. The removal of scope was due to uncertainty in the planned EOR scheme, which removed the need for modifications to the riser guards, pig launcher/receiver installation, and associated piping. Only vessel modification and deck extension work remained in this scope. The removal of scope reduced the planned facilities schedule by 7 months and the planned facilities budget by RM18 million.

In mid- to late 2011, the entire Phase 2 scope was taken through the PETRONAS authorisation process but was not approved.

2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"Static and dynamic models were further revised in October/November 2013 following initial interpretation of newly acquired 3D seismic, which resulted in differences in structure and stratigraphic zones. This drove a change in the depletion planning, which led to the removal of two wells. The project was able to maintain the original wells budget given the increased completion program and drilled footage on the existing wells. The sequencing of wells also changed. The original plan was to drill from the E platform, then the C platform, and then D platform. It was recognised post authorisation that the E wells carried the highest structural risk and as such benefited from being drilled last to ensure additional seismic analysis was included. The sequence then changed to D wells, C wells, followed lastly by E wells.  "

Well D-85 was added to the scope with costs covered by the existing wells budget. On 5 June 2013, the first well was spud. The original plan was to use one rig only; however, during execution it was identified that the assigned rig would likely be delayed. A rig operating nearby became available and was used opportunistically to drill wells on platform D. Key completion equipment was ordered for the full nine-well scope; however, only seven wells were drilled with one workover. Given the additional completion requirements on the seven wells, the team was able to use some of the equipment planned for the two wells that were dropped. In addition, the longer program nature of Samarang Phase 2 means spare equipment can likely be used on later wells. "

The team’s early identification of non-productive time and hands-on work with the drilling contractor meant when problems were identified, proactive mitigation plans were developed. The introduction of a rig coach improved drilling performance and significantly reduced NPT. The multiple swellable packers in each well and high number of zones completed contributed to relatively complex completions. Completion design complexity increased during execution as additional productive zones were discovered via development drilling data acquisition. "

2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"The SMRG 2 Infill Project had a Moderate appraisal philosophy. Although the Samarang field has been producing for many years with multiple penetrations, the Moderate  rating for the appraisal strategy reflects the residual risk in the subsurface environment,  particularly given its high structural and stratigraphic complexities. The late addition of newly CONFIDENTIAL 20 IPA   acquired seismic acted to de-risk elements of appraisal for attic oil drilling; however, at the  time of authorisation, static uncertainty remained."

These three FEL metrics comprise the Asset FEL Index. EXECUTION DISCIPLINE METRICS The measurement of execution discipline is complex. IPA focuses on a simple set of  execution discipline metrics, which are cost effective to collect, including project manager  continuity, the Project Control Index (PCI), and major late changes. CONFIDENTIAL III IPA Other elements of execution discipline can be captured through a “lessons learned”  process. IPA routinely conducts Lessons Learned Workshops in conjunction with closeout  interviews to help teams identify practices to apply to future projects—the real transferable  lessons learned. OUTCOME METRICS IPA has developed a comprehensive set of models that allow a top-down analysis of  project costs and schedules. The costs include project definition, project management,  engineering, materials, installation, and commissioning. The highest level cost benchmark is based on capital cost per barrel for facilities and  drilling. The models compare the project with the industry average capital expenditure per  barrel of oil equivalent ($/BOE). The next level looks at a facilities program cost (concept unspecific), i.e., a benchmark  of the total non-export facility costs. To compare projects consistently, export costs are always  excluded from this metric. On a more detailed level, we benchmark the cost of individual project components,  such as platforms and pipelines. We assess the contingency required for the facilities as a percentage of the base  estimate. We analyse the project’s overall schedule performance. Predictability of project outcomes is also important, so IPA measures both cost and  schedule predictability, as ratios of the outcomes to planned targets.

All FEL Indices have a scale from 3 to 12, with 3 representing the most advanced definition and 12 representing just a sketchy outline of project intent with no real definition work done. (For illustrative purposes, the scale is often truncated at 9 in IPA reports and presentations.) "
2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"To achieve the extreme FEL rating of 3, a team would have to ensure that all FEL  components are completed to a Definitive level, including reservoir appraisal, well and facility  engineering, and regulatory requirements, which requires that all permits are in hand."
2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"However, at the time of sanction, such goals are neither realistic nor necessary. Consequently, for each FEL Index, IPA has identified Best Practical ranges at sanction. For example, engineering would be only 10 to 30 percent completed—with good participation and buy-in of all team members—and the team would have identified all environmental issues and applied for the required permits, but not necessarily received the permits. Therefore, the goal of all project teams should be to achieve Best Practical FEL at sanction, rather than 3.  "
2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"Each of the three upstream discipline FEL Indices has components that address: (1) quality and uncertainty of available data; (2) factors external to the project team such as regulations and company rules; (3) technical deliverables, including the buy-in of all stakeholders; and (4) plans for later phases.

2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"The foundation for a good cost estimate and project schedule is based on a sound understanding of the contractors’ capabilities. In essence, these are the key basic data from which the project execution plan will be crafted. This component rates the project team’s understanding of the contractors’ suitability, contemporary capability to deliver a given scope of work, and availability. Specifically, this component evaluates: • Fabrication Yard (subsea vendor) Availability: This factor measures the contractor’s availability and capability to fabricate the scope. Availability refers to the availability of a yard slot within the anticipated workload for that yard, while capability refers to the yard’s ability to execute the scope (e.g., sufficient space, laydown area, and whether or not yard upgrades are required).  • Labour Availability: This factor refers to the availability and productivity of the labour to fabricate and install the facilities scope. Availability refers to where the labour force will be sourced from and whether sufficient numbers can be found to execute the project within the proposed schedule, while productivity refers to the workforce skills as applicable to the scope and should consider if there are deficiencies in any skill areas.  • Offshore Vessel Availability: This factor measures whether vessel resources for offshore work were contracted and incorporated into the project execution plan.

2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"Stakeholder Definition looks at the non-owner, non-contractor actors that have the ability to impose project scope or execution requirements. The factors listed below measure the project team’s understanding of those external requirements and the maturity of the plans to meet them. Stakeholder Definition does not include joint venture (JV) partners nor does it consider the financial sector. • Environmental Permit Requirements: This factor rates whether the required environmental permits have been identified, applied for, and obtained.  • Local Import of Materials Requirements: This factor reflects the knowledge associated with the logistics for the imported materials. The total amount of imported materials required for the project should be defined, including any storage requirements, and the customs process to clear the material into the country should also be defined and understood.  • Community Relations: This factor measures the understanding of the interactions with the local population and non-governmental organisations, both onshore (e.g., fabrication yard and shore base) and offshore (e.g., fishing communities).  • Local Content Requirements: This factor evaluates if there are any formal or informal requirements to use local nationals for fabrication, installation, and/or operations. The rating does not specifically measure what the requirement is, but rather how compatible the project’s local content plan is with the government expectations.   "

2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"Site Conditions measure the geological and geographical conditions at the project location that require project-specific data and planning. The factors below rate the project team’s understanding of the constraints and conditions specific to the project location and the maturity of the plans to address those conditions in the facility design and execution plan. This component measures: • Soils and Surveying Data: This factor relates to the geotechnical information on and immediately below the seafloor. Geotechnical data include soil borings, a soil strength assessment, a topographical survey, and other seafloor interferences.  • Metocean Criteria: Met-ocean studies primarily refer to weather, wind, wave, and current conditions expected at the project location.  • Offshore Persons-on-Board Requirements: This factor considers two aspects: (1) the number of personnel needed in the offshore environment relative to any limitations on the number of resources that can work on any facility at a given time and (2) the number of available bed spaces for the total number of resources.  • Remote Logistic Requirements: This factor probes the project plans for setting up a shore base to support offshore project execution.

2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"The Team Development Index (TDI) measures the processes that enhance team performance, improve project definition, increase Value Improving Practices (VIPs) use, and drive project outcomes. Strong team development supports Best Practical Front-End Loading (FEL). It is virtually impossible for projects with substandard team development to achieve excellent project definition. Strong team development also supports the selection and implementation of VIPs. VIPs use, combined with strong FEL, further drives positive project results. IPA research shows that team development drives safety, cost, schedules, and operational performance more than other key drivers.26 In other words, when FEL is poor, good team development improves project outcomes. When FEL is average, good team development drives better project outcomes than average or poor team development.  "
2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"The TDI is composed of the following four equally weighted factors:  • Project Objectives: This TDI factor measures whether specific project objectives have been developed and translated from the business objectives, which were developed at the end of the business appraisal stage of FEL (FEL 1). This factor also measures whether these objectives have been communicated to and are understood by all members of the project team. • Team Composition: This TDI factor measures whether all functions that can influence the project’s outcomes are represented on the project team and whether the team is adequately staffed. • Roles and Responsibilities: This TDI factor measures whether roles for team members have been defined, responsibilities have been identified, expectations have been established, and tasks have been outlined and assigned. This component examines whether these responsibilities and tasks have been agreed to and whether the team is aligned. This element also assesses whether risks have been identified and, if identified, whether for developing mitigation plans has been developed and responsibility assigned. • Project Implementation Process: This TDI factor measures whether a common work process is in place for developing and executing the project. It also measures whether this process is used on all company projects and whether this process is understood by the project team. "

2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,The Project Control Index (PCI) measures the set of practices by which a project team manages (or plans to manage) cost and schedule performance during FEL and project execution. The objective of project control is to establish and maintain a disciplined approach to managing work activities during execution so that planned project outcomes are achieved. 
2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"Project control is a process whereby effective cost and schedule performance baseline plans are established (planning, estimating, and scheduling), measurements of performance against the plan are made and evaluated (progressing and forecasting), and corrective action is taken (change management) when measures indicate a deviation from the plan is occurring or is likely to occur. "
2015 Samarang Ph2 Infill CLO (Revised Final).pdf,"During FEL, project control focuses on establishing a cost estimate and schedule that are suitable not only as a basis for project decisions, but also as a basis for control of project activities.

The SOGT Project was an investment by PETRONAS Carigali Sdn BHd (PETRONAS)  intended to design, build, and operate facilities that can receive, process, store, and export oil  and gas production from two offshore fields—oil from Gumusut/Kakap and Malikai (Southern Hub) and gas from Kinabalu and Kebabangan (Northern Hub) in Sabah, Malaysia. The project  was authorised in August 2010 with a budget of MYR4.27 billion4 and target start-up date of March 2013 for Phase 1 and March 2014 for Phase 2. It was rebaselined upon award of the  alliance contractor for overall mechanical completion on 28 December 2013."

PROJECT HISTORY This report is not intended to provide a complete and detailed history of the SOGT Project. The project’s status before authorisation was summarized in the earlier IPA  prospective evaluation.5 Below, we highlight some key milestones and events to provide a  context for the project benchmarks and subsequent conclusions and recommendations. Project Definition The project began in September 2006 when the Petroleum Management Unit (PMU)  awarded the Concept Study and Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) contract to RNZ Integrated (RNZ) Sdn Bhd for an integrated 1,250 MMscfd gas and 300,000 bpd crude  processing facility. At the time, the offshore field development teams were not established and  only raw reservoir data existed. After the Concept Study was completed in January 2007,"
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"FEED began in July 2007, and a competitive bid process started for an owner-managed lump sum (LS) engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning (EPCC) contract. As the project design improved, many scope additions (e.g., inclusion of zero flaring) were included in an addendum to the original invitation-to-bid (ITB) packages.  "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"In mid-2008, the Northern Hub development teams issued updated gas compositions that required major design and scope changes such as the inclusion of large slugcatchers, a dew point system, and export compressors and condensate stabilisation facilities.

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"The updated FEED was issued in March 2009, but FEED reviews in May 2009 and then June 2009 identified many issues to be addressed, some requiring urgent attention (e.g., further geotechnical work on plot locations) to minimise the potential for late change requests by the EPCC contractor. Consequently, the need to address the items from the FEED reviews delayed the bidding start. In response to the FEED reviews, PETRONAS engaged GTS6 in "

Around that time, the business requested the team to devise options for early oil; as a result, a contracting strategy that involved direct management of an engineering contractor by the project team and of a separate procurement, construction, and commissioning (PCC) contractor was investigated due to the business expectation that such a contracting approach would reduce the execution schedule for oil delivery by 4.5 months. As a result, the project team developed two separate ITB packages (EPCC and E&PCC).  "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"In March 2010, the revised FEED phase was completed. However, the business  decided to change the execution contracting strategy from a traditional LS-EPCC contract to 5 Petros Kapoulitsas, A Prospective Evaluation of the Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal Project, IPA, PET-0205-PRO, 2010. 6 Group Technology Solutions CONFIDENTIAL 7 IPA   a LS-EPCC alliance approach. In April 2010, a Peer Independent Review (PIR) was held, the  contracting plan was endorsed using the alliance approach, and the ITB packages were re- issued to nine bidders. The contract award was planned for September 2010, and the planned EPCC execution duration for 42 months from contract award to start-up included 30 months  for Phase 1 and a further 12 months for Phase 2. Authorisation On 29 April 2010, the SOGT Alliance EPCC ITB packages on a lump sum turnkey  (LSTK) basis were issued to nine bidders in a closed competitive bidding process. The  deadline for bids was 29 June 2010, and the EPCC Alliance contract award was planned for September 2010. The contract had a target cost with pain/gain sharing conditions. Technical  and commercial evaluations took 1 month and were completed at the end of July 2010  together with approval from the tendering committee. The SOGT Project received strong support from management to complete the review  in a timely fashion and was eventually authorised with a final approved cost for execution of MYR3.8 billion with a planned mechanical completion date of 29 October 2013 for both  phases. The Alliance contract was awarded on 27 August 2010 to a joint venture comprising Samsung and Naim (Samsung-Naim JV). After the contract award, a kick-off meeting was held in Seoul, South Korea, to identify  roles and responsibilities between PETRONAS and the EPCC Alliance contractor, Samsung- Naim JV.

There were no major scope or design changes on the project. However, the project went through some minor late design optimisation (e.g. removal of one dehydration train, one online burner, and one substation). Following some additional piling tests, piling design was also optimised to reduce the number of points. Detailed HAZOP reviews were completed. 3D models were developed at 30, 60, and 90 percent design completion.  "

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"The project was sanctioned with Fair drivers coupled with a team that was still in development at sanction, with conservative cost and schedule targets. The project could only further improve definition and team development after the EPCC Alliance contractor came on board and became an integrated part of the project team. Despite productivity challenges, the strong focus on cost management helped the project be executed with discipline and no major changes. Overall, actual cost and execution schedule performance were industry average. "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"The project’s safety incident rate was lower than Industry, but included a fatality. These  outcomes are aligned with the opportunity framing objectives which prioritized safety,  schedule, and quality over cost for the SOGT Project. There is an opportunity, however, for PETRONAS to set more competitive cost targets aligned with better than PETRONAS average  drivers at authorisation."
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"As part of the project closeout interview and our subsequent analysis of its results, we identified several lessons learned. IPA’s lessons learned for the SOGT Project are based on our analysis of the project’s performance and the drivers of that performance, as well as our understanding of the Best Practices required for general and reproducible project success.  "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,The lessons learned listed below provide key areas of focus for PETRONAS to improve  the performance of future projects. Some listed items represent opportunities for improvement  while others highlight positive practices that should be repeated on future projects. LESSONS LEARNED
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"1. Recycling FEL to FEL 2 after a major scope change late in definition may extend cycle time, but can prevent the occurrence of issues in execution as a result of incomplete design. The SOGT Project received updated gas composition data in mid-2008 and also identified items that required recycling the FEED package before issuing the tender. By recycling back to FEL 2 to incorporate the changes and update the FEED package, instead of proceeding with the new information into execution, the SOGT Project achieved Advanced Study engineering definition (which is Best Practical) and reduced the risk of late changes.  "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"2. Ensuring that the local construction contractors’ and local labour force’s availability and ability are accounted for in project execution plans will help reduce execution issues and improve the likelihood of success. With the constraint of local content requirement for construction work, the SOGT Project anticipated the poor local labour productivity and lack of construction management skills from local contractors, and some cost and schedule allowances were made. However, the project’s construction progress was affected, and there are lessons learned for "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,PETRONAS to mitigate against similar situations. There are two basic strategies  for dealing with low skill levels: (1) increase the amount and quality of construction  supervision and/or (2) provide extensive craft skills training for the project. PETRONAS significantly increased construction contractor support and oversight  and paired low-skill local contractors with experienced global contractors.
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"3. The disposition of PETRONAS team members towards the selected contracting strategy served the project well and allowed the project team to optimally coordinate execution. To compensate for lean resources, the project team awarded the EPCC scope using an alliance concept. The selected contractor became an integral part of the project team and the project formed an Alliance Integrated Team, comprising both PETRONAS and contractor staff. Despite the lack of experience with alliance contracting, PETRONAS project leadership nurtured and promoted "

This, coupled with good  project controls during execution, facilitated timely resolution of issues and good  change control. 4. Applying safety Best Practices that fit the local context improves safety outcomes."
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Despite using almost all of the safety Best Practices and setting appropriate safety targets, the SOGT Project suffered one fatality. Safety management, including training, is paramount for such complex, highly labour-intensive jobs, and the contractor workforce’s experience and its effects on safety need to be subject to a “deep dive” analysis. This was the first time PETRONAS, and its EPCC Alliance contractor carried out work in Sabah, and had limited knowledge of the local workforce capability, which only became a clearer “known unknown” after formation of the AIT. The local contractors were new to delivering on a project of such large magnitude and required close supervision by the team and the partner global construction contractors, who, for a number of them, were also new to the region. "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"For future projects in new areas for PETRONAS, a thorough analysis of potential local contractors should be reviewed during project definition to identify the minimal requirement for construction management, including safety management, by the owner team, the construction management contractor and the construction contractors.

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,Project. The good project controls and lack of major late changes or project manager turnover helped the SOGT Project achieve cost and schedule predictability targets. The SOGT Project maintained control and prevented major late changes through the use of the four project control Best Practices:  • Use of an owner cost specialist to validate cost estimate • Use of detailed physical progressing • Frequent and detailed progress status reporting • Assignment of an owner project control specialist 
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"RECOMMENDATIONS We provide the following recommendation to improve PETRONAS’ project results: 1. By achieving better FEL while maintaining strong project controls, more aggressive  cost and schedule targets can be set. If a project is supported by strong drivers,  then failure to set appropriately aggressive targets is an opportunity cost. The"

Projects with stronger drivers, especially Best Practical FEL, can expect to achieve better than industry average cost and schedule performance; these expectations are the motivation for performing better FEL. "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"PETRONAS needs to maintain its focus on setting aggressive targets and planning  effectively to do so, because it is more likely to achieve such targets when a project  has good definition and is executed with discipline. In the case of the SOGT Project, the team followed through with good project  controls and, by executing the project with discipline and with no project manager  turnover, was able to achieve predictable results.

This TDI rating is better than the PETRONAS average and is comparable to Industry. The main gaps at authorisation were the lack of an integrated team, lack of roles and  responsibilities, and lack of a defined alliance organisation structure.

The SOGT Project team did not investigate technologies available for the total project scope. The gas plant was based on existing technology employed by other PETRONAS facilities. However, the team evaluated different technologies for the gas dehydration system before selecting the DRIZO high-purity glycol system. In addition, a similar exercise determined the best technology for enhanced liquid recovery from the gas stream. In this case, the turbo-expansion option was selected. • Process Simplification was not used. The process was not subject to a function analysis that focused on eliminating chemical or physical processing steps from the project.

The objective of FEL is to gain a detailed understanding of the project to minimise changes during project execution. FEL proceeds until the right project is selected and is not finished until a full design-basis package has been completed. FEL includes project definition and process design, such as the development of flowsheets and the first set of P&IDs.  "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"The FEL Index is composed of three equally weighted factors. The first of the three  factors is broken down further into four equally weighted subfactors: 1. The completeness of work on a set of site-specific items   • Plot plans and unit configurations   • Soils and hydrology work   • Site-specific environmental regulatory requirements   • Site-specific health and safety requirements 2. The status of project execution planning 3. The status of project engineering for the facility The overall FEL Index is obtained by calculating the average of the scores for the first  four subfactors and adding this average to the scores for project execution planning and  project engineering. The FEL Index ranges from 3.00 to 12.00. However, the Best Practical FEL Index ranges from 4.00 to 4.75."
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"To achieve the best possible FEL Index of 3.00, a team must ensure that the FEL factors are Definitive, including engineering, which requires that at least 70 percent of the engineering has been completed, and environmental requirements, which requires that all environmental permits are in hand. However, at the time of authorisation, these goals are neither realistic nor necessary. Consequently, the Best Practical value at authorisation assumes that only 10 to 30 percent of the engineering has been completed—with good participation and buy-in of all team members—and that the team has identified all environmental issues and applied for the required permits, but has not necessarily received the permits. Therefore, the goal of all project teams at the time of authorisation should be to achieve a Best Practical FEL value of from 4.00 to 4.75, rather than 3.00.  "

If no information is available about the conditions of the soils (such as if the site had not yet been selected), then the factor is rated Not Used. The Assumed/Factored rating applies if no specific information is available about the site, but the general location conditions are known. When an incomplete set of site borings or a cursory analysis of structural integrity is available, the factor is rated Preliminary.

Successful VIPs’ use requires a structured, disciplined, and documented approach with measured results: • The VIP activities must be scheduled and resourced early during a project's life cycle for these practices to have their maximum effect on project costs. Moreover, resources must be set aside so that the practices may be satisfactorily implemented, perhaps even using individuals external to the project to oversee the application. • The VIP activities must be done thoroughly. For example, ensuring that a project employs the best available technology—the goal of the Technology Selection "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"VIP—requires identification of potential candidates through rigorous patent searches, visits to university research centres and process licensors, and the subsequent evaluation of these candidates. Thorough application of this VIP means that the potential candidates cannot be limited to only those of whom the firm is currently aware. • The VIP must be applied to the full scope of the project (at least initially). Arbitrarily limiting the scope to a portion of the project unnecessarily limits the practices' potential effects. • Guidelines must exist to ensure that each VIP is applied consistently: which costs to evaluate (e.g., total life cycle cost) and which economic and financial assumptions to use. • The results of VIPs’ application must be documented. Documentation is performed to provide a basis for the project team to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the practice and to provide lessons learned for future project teams.

The objective is to maximise the total  return by selecting the most economical methods of heat and power recovery. Predictive Maintenance An approach to maintaining a facility whereby equipment is monitored and repairs are  made before failure. Typically, this approach requires adding various measurement  devices to evaluate operating characteristics. Process Reliability Modelling A simulation technique to examine operability targets for a facility.

Typically, specialised computer software, a  consultant, or both are necessary. Process Simplification A disciplined analytical method for reducing investment costs—and often operating  costs as well—by either combining or making unnecessary one or more chemical or  physical processing steps. Technology Selection A systematic process by which a company searches for production technology outside  of the company (or, in some instances, in other divisions within the company) that may  be superior to that currently employed in its manufacturing plants. Value Engineering A disciplined method used during design, requiring the use of a trained Value Engineering consultant—usually from outside the project team—aimed at eliminating or  modifying items that do not contribute to meeting business needs.

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"The Project Control Index (PCI) measures the set of practices by which a project team manages (or plans to manage) cost and schedule performance during the Front-End Loading (FEL) and execution phases of a project. The objective of project control is to establish and maintain a disciplined approach to managing work activities during execution so that planned project outcomes are achieved. As the term implies, project control is a “control” process whereby effective cost and schedule performance baseline plans are established (planning, estimating, and scheduling), measurements of performance against the plan are made and evaluated (progressing and forecasting), and corrective action is taken (change management) when measures indicate a deviation from the plan is occurring or is likely to occur.

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"One of the primary areas of concern within a company’s project system is the assignment of reliable contingency allowances in project cost estimates. Appropriate levels of contingency that reflect project risks allow better understanding of likely project costs. Ideally, the base estimate (i.e., the estimate without contingency) should include the costs of known items, and the contingency allowance should cover the costs of unknown items. The contingency allowance should then provide a determinable level of confidence that the total cost estimate, including contingency, will not be overrun because of unpredictable, although not extraordinary, events. Contingency is not intended to provide a guarantee that the total cost of a project will not exceed its authorised budget. Instead, contingency represents an allowance of funds to achieve a desired probability that a cost overrun will not occur. "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Setting the contingency too high or too low costs money. If contingency is too high, project teams or management has a strong tendency to consume some or even all of the appropriated money on items outside of the authorised scope. If contingency is set too low, the project will have unrealistic cost control budgets that will tend to drive the team to pursue risky, ineffective, or inefficient execution practices in an attempt to meet the unrealistic target (in other words, the project is more likely to lose control). Also, setting contingency too low tends to erode cost discipline and can lead to time wasted on creative accounting. Finally, with contingency set too low, reductions in scope and/or the rejection of desirable design improvements can result. "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Contingency is closely related to, but distinct from, allowances, such as material take-off allowances or allowances for the event of extreme weather conditions. Contingency is not a reserve or slush fund that the project team cannot spend on the authorised project scope without upper management approval. Likewise, management should not have the expectation that, if a project team does its job well, contingency will not be spent. Both of these views contribute to distortion of the base estimate. When repeated throughout a project system, this distortion makes prediction of total system expenditure difficult.  "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Although often not specifically identified as such, contingency is contained in most project cost estimates. Approaches to assigning contingency are often arbitrary and fail to adjust for the status of project definition at the time of estimate preparation. IPA has developed a systematic method of determining the amount of contingency required for a project based on a parametric statistical model. We formulated this model by collecting detailed histories of projects and identifying key factors that drive differences between project estimates and actual cost outcomes. "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,IPA’S APPROACH TO CONTINGENCY
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"IPA’s statistical model, called the Contingency Allowance Model (CAM), is used to provide an industry benchmark of the contingency level required to achieve various levels of confidence of overrun or underrun. The CAM predicts contingency percentages for each project based on a regression analysis that includes important project drivers and characteristics. The variables included in the model are those that IPA has found to be the strongest drivers of contingency requirements. We detail the model drivers in the following section. "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"The CAM does not attempt to capture all the reasons that actual costs might deviate from estimated costs. Some events and situations that can affect project costs are not, in principle, predictable by estimators. For example, unusually bad weather, labour strikes, shortages of labour and equipment, currency fluctuations, and inflation are risks that can be "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"CONFIDENTIAL L IPA   assessed in only a rudimentary way by estimators.36 Therefore, IPA systematically removes  these external factors from our analysis of capital cost estimation. The CAM is used to provide industry benchmarks of contingency required to achieve  various levels of confidence of an overrun or underrun. Each project has unique risk factors  that should be reflected in the estimate contingency, but may not be considered in the CAM. As such, IPA recommends that the project team conduct risk analyses and prepare  contingency estimates that reflect the identified risks. THE COMPONENTS OF THE CAM Equipment Percentage"
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Because major equipment estimates tend to be based on firm quotes, equipment cost is the cost category that experiences the least cost growth. Even for early estimates using historical data or budget quotes, equipment costs tend to be more accurate than estimates for other cost accounts. Therefore, projects that have a high equipment component typically require less contingency.  "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,Project Definition Level
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Project definition (as reflected in the FEL Index) is one of the most important elements in the CAM and has a large influence on the required contingency. However, some elements of definition, such as local labour availability and heat and material balances, also have particular significance. Because FEL is such an important driver of many IPA models, it is discussed in detail in the Front-End Loading Appendix. "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Contracting and Execution Strategy Projects executed using lump-sum contracts typically require less explicit contingency  than other contracting strategies. Lump-sum contracts move much of a project’s risk from the  owner to the contractor, who then compensates by adding contingency to the bid price."
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Execution strategy affects contingency use because, if a project is cost driven, it is less likely to take actions and make changes that will put cost at risk. If a project is schedule driven (i.e., the project team is willing to spend money to achieve its schedule objective), it may employ schedule compression methods, such as overtime and project controls that are difficult to estimate. "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,Company Cost Culture
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Contingency requirements are a function not only of risk drivers and the events that transpire during project execution, but also of the base estimate risk and quality. Projects with conservative (i.e., high confidence) base estimates require less contingency than projects with aggressive, higher risk estimates.  "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"If a company cost culture is punitive (i.e., some adverse effect will occur to the project team members’ careers if project costs overrun), the team will take actions to ensure that an overrun is not likely. The easiest way to do that is to hide contingency or allowances in the                                                 "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"36 The rate of cost escalation (inflation) is an example of a factor that changes project costs, but that estimators cannot predict. Economic modelers are unable to estimate the rate of inflation not only in a narrow segment of the economy, such as the chemical process industries, but also in the overall economy despite the millions of dollars spent each year on these efforts. Lower than expected inflation can bail out a bad estimate, just as unexpectedly high inflation can vitiate a good one. In neither case is the estimator responsible. "

As a result, although the total contingency consumed is at least as great as in a more forgiving culture, less explicit contingency is required. Typical evidence of this type of culture is that the company rarely overruns any project budgets, and many projects underrun their base estimates.  "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"If a company cost culture is one that strives to achieve aggressive, but realistic, targets  and expects that some cost overruns will occur (without punishment), more contingency may  be required because no “fat” is in the estimate to cover uncertainties. Estimate Inclusiveness Estimate inclusiveness is based on a checklist of cost items and elements that are  normally included in total project costs. If an item is excluded from the cost estimate that is  likely to be expended later, cost growth will occur. Process Impurity Problems"
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,IPA rates process impurity problems on a scale that measures the extent to which impurities in process streams were considered problematic during research and design (R&D) and early design. Impurity removal is typically difficult to simulate and therefore carries increased uncertainty. Processes with recycle streams are particularly prone to such difficulties because many are catalyst-dependent processes.  
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,Integrated Project Teams IPA research shows that having an integrated team results in better overall project  performance. IPA data overwhelmingly demonstrate that projects with integrated teams  require less contingency than projects without integrated teams. The Use of New Technology
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Projects involving block steps that are implementing new technology—that is, technology that has no commercial history either within the owner company or elsewhere—have been historically proven to require more contingency. Block steps that include new technology, or new steps as we call them, may involve new chemistry, first-of-a-kind major equipment, or existing equipment performing a new service. New technologies are associated with more risk than both proven technologies and new integrations because Industry has little or no experience with a new technology. As a result, the use of new technology increases the required contingency. "

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"The process complexity of the project is related to needs for higher contingency allowances. Complexity is defined in our system as the number of continuously linked process steps, counted on a block basis, in a facility. Parallel trains are counted only once, and the control system and off-sites are not included. For processes that will be operated in batch mode, the number of continuously linked steps is the maximum number of steps required to make any one purified intermediate. "

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"The Engineering and Construction Schedule Model (ECSM) estimates the time required from detailed engineering through mechanical completion. Many factors—such as equipment delivery delays, strikes, unusually bad weather, and cash flow or budget restrictions—can increase the execution duration. On the other hand, the use of overtime and double shifts reduces the time required for execution. The effects of these factors and actions have been systematically removed from the ECSM. The benchmarks from the ECSM assume the following: (1) no delays are caused by external factors such as strikes or bad weather and (2) single-shift operations of 40 hours to 45 hours (straight time) are used.

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,Project Definition The most influential components of project definition that affect engineering and  construction schedule outcomes are site-specific factors and project execution planning. Both  factors are measured at authorisation time.
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Site-specific factors encompass the detail known about the plot plans (i.e., the layout of the equipment to be used for a project); the extent to which the soils, including borings, contamination, and load-bearing capacity, have been considered; and whether the team has performed an analysis to determine whether obstructions are present. Each aspect of site factors is rated on a scale that ranges from 1 to 4, with 1 as Definitive and 4 as Not Used.  "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Project execution planning relates to the following three areas: 1. Project team: The composition of the project team, including the assignment and  understanding of roles 2. Contracting strategy: The contracting strategy that has been selected and the  planning thereof 3. Schedule: The development of a detailed, integrated project schedule that  incorporates the planned equipment delivery dates, the site size restrictions,  resource-loading, and turnover and commissioning sequences Project Management Turnover The ECSM indicates that any change in the owner’s project manager, occurring either  late in FEL or after authorisation, leads to a longer engineering and construction schedule. CONFIDENTIAL LIV IPA Process Impurity Problems"
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Process impurity problems are rated on a scale that ranges from zero to 5. Zero indicates that no problem exists, and 5 means that a major problem exists. The scale measures the extent to which impurities in the process streams were problematic during research and development and early design. Processes with recycle streams, like many catalyst-dependent processes, are particularly prone to such difficulties. This scale helps predict cost growth because resolving problems associated with impurities often requires expensive changes in the equipment design. "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,Contracting Strategy Another significant driver of schedule that is accounted for in the ECSM is contracting  strategy. Projects executed using lump-sum engineering and construction contracts are  typically faster than industry average. Project Characteristics

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Typically, as the duration of the engineering-construction overlap increases, the number of delays and inefficiencies in construction also increase. Often, this overlap means that construction will be delayed while the team waits for drawings or that the construction schedule will be determined based on when the drawings will become available. These methods may, or may not, result in the most efficient construction order. "

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Clarity of business objectives and the trade-offs among cost, schedule, and functionality are essential to capital project success. Clear objectives shorten FEL time requirements and greatly improve FEL completeness, thereby improving all outcomes. The best available tool for improving the clarity of objectives is Classes of Facility Quality (CFQ) or an equivalent process. Research shows that the use of CFQ improves the clarity of objectives and allows the project team to understand the trade-offs between cost, schedule, and functionality. "

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"CFQ is a structured process, usually done via a workshop format, that brings the business sponsors together with the core project team (including manufacturing) to address: • What is the business seeking to accomplish? • What are the project priorities? • What are the implications of the priorities on the scope, including the details of the scope? • How will disagreements between manufacturing and the project be negotiated and controlled? • How will the project team be kept current with any changes to the business case? • How will the business be kept informed of any surprises during project development?

F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"Front-End Loading (FEL) begins when the decision that a distinct opportunity exists for which a capital project should be developed, and project engineering is then brought in to help define what that project should be. The project team led by the business group engages in a series of activities to evaluate alternative capital and noncapital solutions. FEL proceeds until the ""right"" project is selected and is not finished until a full design-basis package is completed. "
F1_PET2402CLO.pdf,"FEL includes project definition and process design (such as development of flowsheets and  the first set of piping and instrumentation diagrams [P&IDs]). The FEL Index is composed of three equally weighted factors. For pipeline and  distribution projects, one of the three factors is broken down further into six equally weighted  subcomponents. The following is a list of the three factors and their respective  subcomponents. 1. The completeness of work on a set of site-related items   • Route definition   • Terrain conditions   • Right-of-Way (ROW) issues   • Community issues   • Health and safety requirements   • Permitting/environmental requirements 2.

F1_PET2802CLO_ Bardegg2.pdf,Front-End Loading (FEL) is the process by which an organization translates its opportunities into capital projects. The objective of FEL is to develop a detailed understanding of the project scope that meets the business objectives. FEL proceeds until the right project is selected and is not finished until a full design-basis package has been completed.  
F1_PET2802CLO_ Bardegg2.pdf,"IPA measures FEL separately for the different E&P disciplines: Reservoir FEL, Offshore/Onshore Facilities FEL, Well Program FEL, and Pipeline FEL. The most leveraging of the FEL measures is Reservoir FEL because it develops the basic data for the asset development: It is the premise of the  project. When project teams lack adequate basic reservoir data, the advancement of Facilities FEL, Well Program FEL, and Pipeline FEL is constrained, and project outcomes are generally  disappointing. To provide a quick reflection of the overall project definition, IPA has developed a combined index— the Asset FEL Index. This combined index is correlated with asset growth.

These practices need to follow a consistent process, with  documentation and usually facilitation. In addition, for maximum benefit, these practices should be  coupled with optimal project definition and applied to the project at the right time. Value Engineering is the examination of what is needed to meet the business objectives of a project  and the elimination of non-value-adding investment. In FEL 2, this practice is sometimes called Process Simplification. Value Engineering (in FEL 2 or FEL 3) is a structured, rigorous process to  search for opportunities to eliminate or combine process steps, equipment, piping, valves, and/or  other supporting process material. Value Engineering was used in FEL 3 and the session was facilitated by an external party. A FAST  model was employed for the session, which found US$18 million in cost savings. During execution,  the team and EPCC contractor conducted an additional round of Value Engineering. Constructability Reviews are systematic examinations of the design, plans, and sequencing as they  affect construction efficiency. They can be used from FEL 2 through early execution. Constructability Reviews were used in FEL 3 and execution. Two Constructability Reviews were  carried out prior to FID and one during execution.

F2_PET2805_CLO_RGT2.pdf,"As shown in the charts above, the RGT2 Project’s field labour hours are higher than 50 percent range of the comparison dataset and CEC Malaysia/Singapore projects. The use of double shifts, as mentioned in the report, is a contributor to the high labour hours. The higher hours, in turn, contributed to the high construction labour costs.                                                  "
